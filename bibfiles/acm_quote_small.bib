abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into software engineering and computer science education, it is crucial to understand their impact on student learning. While recent research has explored student perceptions of generative AI, little is known about how these tools influence students’ cognitive processes during programming tasks, such as code comprehension, a valuable skill in software development and maintenance. This paper presents the design of a study that aims to investigate how computer science students interact with LLMs, such as Google’s Gemini, in the context of code summarization using eye-tracking. This study will examine differences in visual attention, fixation behaviors, and performance of students engaged in code summarization with and without AI assistance across varying experience levels.},

abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into educational technology, their potential to assist in developing curricula has gained interest among educators. Despite this growing attention, their applicability in culturally responsive Indigenous educational settings like Hawai‘i’s public schools and Kaiapuni (immersion language) programs, remains understudied. Additionally, ‘undefinedlelo Hawai‘i, the Hawaiian language, as a low-resource language, poses unique challenges and concerns about cultural sensitivity and the reliability of generated content. Through surveys and interviews with kumu (educators), this study explores the perceived benefits and limitations of using LLMs for culturally revitalizing computer science (CS) education in Hawaiian public schools with Kaiapuni programs. Our findings highlight AI’s time-saving advantages while exposing challenges such as cultural misalignment and reliability concerns. We conclude with design recommendations for future AI tools to better align with Hawaiian cultural values and pedagogical practices, towards the broader goal of trustworthy, effective, and culturally grounded AI technologies.},

abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable experienced programmers to increase their productivity, LLMs' impact on learning and productivity for novices is currently unclear. Recent work showed novice programmers struggle with prompting LLMs for code generation and suggested that the use of LLMs in CS education could exacerbate existing equity issues. Educators are now faced with the difficult question of whether and when to incorporate the use of LLMs into the CS curriculum without adversely impacting student learning and equity. To address these concerns, we study the effects of using an interactive LLM on code generation with novice programmers. We find that using our interactive LLM improves the accuracy of code generation over the baseline LLM. Additionally, after using the interactive LLM, novices write improved prompts even when using the baseline LLM. Based on our findings, we plan to create iGPTs, a set of customized, interactive LLMs spanning CS education learning goals as templates to facilitate LLM integration for improving student learning and retention.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly better at a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks (NLP), such as text generation and understanding. Recently, these models have extended their capabilities to coding tasks, bridging the gap between natural languages (NL) and programming languages (PL). Foundational models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and LLaMA series have set strong baseline performances in various NL and PL tasks. Additionally, several models have been fine-tuned specifically for code generation, showing significant improvements in code-related applications. Both foundational and fine-tuned models are increasingly used in education, helping students write, debug, and understand code. We present a comprehensive systematic literature review to examine the impact of LLMs in computer science and computer engineering education. We analyze their effectiveness in enhancing the learning experience, supporting personalized education, and aiding educators in curriculum development. We address five research questions to uncover insights into how LLMs contribute to educational outcomes, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research.},

We present our preliminary work on developing prompt-engineering strategies to mitigate bias in content generated by LLMs in computer science (CS) education. This work investigates both empirical insights into fairness-aware prompt formulation and actionable takeaways for educators. We focus on an initial list of prompting strategies for mitigating bias and explore their impact on educational content generation. Recent research has shown the efficacy of prompt-base debiasing [1] as well as the potential disadvantages of using prompts that have not been mitigated for bias, from user dissatisfaction [2] to unsafe outputs [5, 6]. Additionally, a growing body of empirical work points to the idea that certain properties of in-context examples such as flow [7], illustration [3], and order [4] could either improve or derail LLM performance. Our study leverages these findings in the context of generating educational content. The goal is to promote fairness-aware approaches which can be applied to the automated generation of learning materials and the development of LLM-based educational tools. This work also contributes practical insights on prompt-engineering to the evolving curriculum of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI).},

abstract = {As the prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows in various sectors, their potential in education warrants exploration. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

abstract = {While many recent studies have explored how large language models can transform computer science instruction from the instructor perspective, they are primarily at the college level. Thus, little is known about using large language models towards curriculum development and teacher supports outside of the college setting. Given the emphasis placed on culturally responsive teaching at the K-8 level and well-documented evidence of insensitive and inaccurate language model outputs from a cultural perspective, it is imperative to perform systematic and principled research before considering their use in this setting.This paper explores the potential of teachers using large language models to brainstorm instructional Scratch projects. Specifically, we use GPT-3 to mimic structured projects from an existing computer science curriculum but situate the generated projects in different contexts/themes. We qualitatively analyze 300 project ideas generated by GPT and find 81% of the generated ideas satisfy our metrics for technical alignment and theme quality. We identify two major weaknesses: code complexity of generated projects and presence of potential insensitive elements that would require human filtering. We conclude that, while not ready as a student-facing solution, teachers could use GPT to effectively brainstorm customized instructional materials.},

abstract = {Software testing is a challenging topic in software engineering education and requires creative approaches to engage learners. For example, the Code Defenders game has students compete over a Java class under test by writing effective tests and mutants. While such gamified approaches deal with problems of motivation and engagement, students may nevertheless require help to put testing concepts into practice. The recent widespread diffusion of Generative AI and Large Language Models raises the question of whether and how these disruptive technologies could address this problem, for example, by providing explanations of unclear topics and guidance for writing tests. However, such technologies might also be misused or produce inaccurate answers, which would negatively impact learning. To shed more light on this situation, we conducted the first empirical study investigating how students learn and practice new software testing concepts in the context of the Code Defenders testing game, supported by a smart assistant based on a widely known, commercial Large Language Model. Our study shows that students had unrealistic expectations about the smart assistant, “blindly” trusting any output it generated, and often trying to use it to obtain solutions for testing exercises directly. Consequently, students who resorted to the smart assistant more often were less effective and efficient than those who did not. For instance, they wrote 8.6% fewer tests, and their tests were not useful in 78.0% of the cases. We conclude that giving unrestricted and unguided access to Large Language Models might generally impair learning. Thus, we believe our study helps to raise awareness about the implications of using Generative AI and Large Language Models in Computer Science Education and provides guidance towards developing better and smarter learning tools.},

abstract = {Software development is undergoing a revolutionary transformation, fueled by remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). This wave of innovation is reshaping the entire landscape and holds the promise of streamlining the development process, leading to increased productivity and efficiency. By providing text prompts, developers can now receive entirely generated code outputs, representing a fundamental shift in how software is built. This paradigm change can accelerate development cycles and unlock new levels of creativity and ingenuity, resulting in the realization of novel applications and business outcomes. However, this paradigm shift also brings new challenges and necessitates acquiring additional skills for software developers to fully harness the capabilities of LLM-powered tools. These skills include prompt engineering for software development, structural complexity management, debugging of AI errors, and compliance with ethical guidelines and principles.The special session will introduce our NSF-sponsored 3-year project, which aims to integrate LLMs into the standard CS curriculum. To the best of our knowledge, this project is among the first department-level initiatives to renovate CS curriculum, rather than individual courses, with the new developments of LLMs. Our project focuses on (a) enhancing students' problem-solving and programming skills by leveraging LLMs as a learning tool in core programming courses, (b) improving students' software development skills by integrating LLM-powered tools into the software engineering course sequence, and (c) educating students on ethical and responsible AI practices. The special session will discuss the objectives and methods of our project, as well as the current results and lessons learned.This NSF-supported project aims to integrate LLMs into the standard CS curriculum. The revolutionized computer science education will cultivate a new generation of AI-powered responsible developers. The objectives are to enhance student programming, software development, and problem-solving skills; educate students on ethical and responsible AI practices; and develop faculty development materials and workshops.

This paper discusses the necessity and urgency for software engineering education to adapt and evolve to prepare software engineers for the emerging LLM environment.

abstract = {New breakthroughs in code synthesis from Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms are driving significant changes to software engineering education. Having algorithms able to generate components of a software project means that software developers will need stronger skills in requirements specification to guide code generation as well as stronger skills in code review, testing, and integration to incorporate AI-generated code into projects. Shifts in industry and classroom practices are already occurring with the availability of inline code generation tools like GitHub's Copilot, which makes discussion of pedagogical strategies in this area a timely topic. Of immediate concern in computer science education is the potential for LLM-generated code and code help to undermine the learning of CS students. In order to avoid such undermining in even intentional uses of LLM-enhanced learning supports, it is necessary to clarify the roles such supports need to play in the pedagogical process. The Computer Science Matrix Taxonomy provides a strong framework for organizing software testing learning outcomes as well as delineating the operational space in which LLM-based feedback tools should operate to support those learning outcomes. In this paper, the authors operationalize the CS Matrix Taxonomy for software testing learning outcomes and illustrate the integration of LLM-generated test strategy suggestions as an extension of the peer coding/testing model. The work includes examples of AI-generated code testing suggestions that students would use to help guide their own code synthesis for assignments or projects.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has raised concerns among computer science educators about how programming assignments should be adapted. This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude Sonnet) in solving complete, multi-part CS homework assignments from the SIGCSE Nifty Assignments list. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we found that LLM performance varied significantly across different assignments and models, with Claude Sonnet consistently outperforming the others. The presence of starter code and test cases improved performance for advanced LLMs, while certain assignments, particularly those involving visual elements, proved challenging for all models. LLMs often disregarded assignment requirements, produced subtly incorrect code, and struggled with context-specific tasks. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for designing LLM-resistant assignments. Our work provides insights for instructors to evaluate and adapt their assignments in the age of AI, balancing the potential benefits of LLMs as learning tools with the need to ensure genuine student engagement and learning.},

abstract = {The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) many instructors for Computer Science courses have begun to opt to allow students to use them as an additional educational resource but often warn that the output may be unreliable. Recent research on LLMs has demonstrated their ability to interpret commands in natural language and produce code in a variety of programming languages. However, it is not clear how well LLMs fair in tackling more complex problem set ups, like those typically seen in Algorithms courses in which students are provided natural language descriptions of an ambiguous problem and use what they learn to map the problem to an algorithmic solution. In this paper, we explore use of LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, as tools for assisting students with complex Computer Science curricula, such as algorithmic problem solving. We specifically aim to see if using prompt refinement techniques, LLMs are capable of taking a problem statement in plain English and performing the following tasks: providing both a natural language description and code solution in the Python programming language, producing an analytical argument for the solutions correctness, and finally providing runtime analysis for the produced solution. Our experiments show that GPT-4o is well suited to solving problems like LeetCode 75 that have been seen during training, and prompt-refinement helps with those that have not been seen.},

However, their impact on improving software quality in educational settings remains uncertain. This article explores our experience teaching the use of Programming Mistake Detector (PMD) to foster a culture of bug fixing and leverage LLM to improve software quality in the classroom. This article discusses the results of an experiment involving 155 submissions that carried out a code review activity of 1,658 rules. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that a set of PMD quality issues influences the acceptance or rejection of the issues, and design-related categories that take longer to resolve. Although students acknowledge the potential of using ChatGPT during code review, some skepticism persists. Further, constructing prompts for ChatGPT that possess clarity, complexity, and context nurtures vital learning outcomes, such as enhanced critical thinking, and among the 1,658 issues analyzed, 93% of students indicated that ChatGPT did not identify any additional issues beyond those detected by PMD. Conversations between students and ChatGPT encompass five categories, including ChatGPT’s use of affirmation phrases like “certainly” regarding bug fixing decisions, and apology phrases such as “apologize” when resolving challenges. Through this experiment, we demonstrate that code review can become an integral part of the educational computing curriculum. We envision our findings to enable educators to support students with effective code review strategies, increasing awareness of LLMs, and promoting software quality in education.},

This talk presents an innovative curriculum approach, integrating AI tools into an advanced CS capstone course at a stage where students possess foundational skills in software engineering. This strategic timing ensures students can critically engage with AI, recognizing biases and managing challenges like hallucinations in AI-generated outputs.Before redesigning the curriculum, independent research was conducted to understand the strengths and limitations of various AI tools, such as Lucidchart, Eraser.io for design documentation, and GitHub Copilot, GPT-4, Codeium, Claude, and Gemini for implementation tasks like code generation, code completion, UI design, error handling, and API integration. This research guided the curriculum by shaping assignment design and delivering foundational lectures on prompt engineering to ease the learning curve for students. Experiments during the capstone course included AI-enhanced assignments and projects, where students applied these tools for software design and implementation. Quantitative data-prompt refinement counts, error rates, code accuracy, and qualitative reflections revealed increased confidence in AI tools, enhanced productivity, and greater readiness for industry roles. Despite these benefits, students faced challenges with complex tasks that required iterative refinement and oversight, but they gained skills in managing biases and hallucinations in AI outputs. The curriculum's ''right-left'' approach enables a smooth transition to AI-assisted development, preparing students for the evolving tech landscape.

abstract = {SQL stands as the foundational language for data analysis and manipulation, playing a pivotal role in the database learning process. Proficiency in SQL is essential for students seeking to excel in data-related fields. However, the conventional approaches to assessing SQL queries rely heavily on manual grading, and the automated assessment tools are usually producing only binary decisions for the submitted queries. Our primary research objective is to develop effective methods for evaluating the quality of the SQL queries. To meet this objective, we introduce two approaches: structure-based analysis and evaluation by an instruction tuned large language model (LLM). The first approach deconstructs queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and employs cosine similarity to assess student submissions. The second approach utilizes a pre-trained LLM: FLAN-T5, fine-tuned for predicting the quality of student submissions. These methodologies are tested on a SQL dataset, and our experimental findings evaluate against a grading rubric with categories ranging from "good" to "unacceptable". The experimental results demonstrate that we can enhance the grading efficiency by applying these approaches and illustrate the ability of utilizing LLM to classify the assessed SQL statements more accurately. In addition, this research contributes to Computer Science (CS) education by integrating these approaches into our team's automated SQL statement assessment tool, improving the learning experience and evaluation process.},

Although the main focus of general-purpose LLMs is not code generation, they have shown promising results in the domain. However, the usefulness of LLMs in an academic software engineering project has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we explore the usefulness of LLMs for 214 students working in teams consisting of up to six members. Notably, in the academic course through which this study is conducted, students were encouraged to integrate LLMs into their development tool-chain, in contrast to most other academic courses that explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.In this paper, we analyze the AI-generated code, prompts used for code generation, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base. We also conduct a perception study to gain insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLM from a computer science student's perspective. Our findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures, and helping with syntax and error debugging. These insights provide us with a framework on how to effectively utilize LLMs as a tool to enhance the productivity of software engineering students, and highlight the necessity of shifting the educational focus toward preparing students for successful human-AI collaboration.},

Structured prompts emphasized problem decomposition, real-world context, and code examples, enabling tailored support while mitigating over-reliance on AI. Results demonstrated the hybrid approach’s efficacy, with students in the ChatGPT-assisted group scoring 16.50 points higher on average and excelling in advanced topics. However, ChatGPT’s limitations necessitated TA verification. This framework highlights the dual role of LLMs: augmenting TA efficiency while ensuring accuracy through human oversight, offering a scalable solution for human-AI collaboration in education.},

abstract = {This paper presents a case study that evaluates the effectiveness of coding Large Language Models (LLMs) in introductory computer science courses at the university level. The study assesses six different AI-powered code generators. The evaluation focuses on the accuracy of these AI code generators in solving ten programming problems from a set of problems that instructors at Duke University can assign to students for weekly completion. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of coding LLMs in solving these problems.Based on the findings, the paper discusses the challenges faced by the computer science education community and potential strategies to address them. The advent of coding LLMs poses significant challenges to traditional teaching and learning methods in computer science. These challenges include the need for strategies to mitigate any negative impact of LLMs on the learning process. At the same time, these code LLMs also offer tremendous opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning.},

In computing education, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these models to improve learning and teaching experiences in university-level programming courses. However, research into leveraging them to aid computer science instructors in curriculum development and course material design is relatively sparse, especially at the K-12 level. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the capability of large language models in ideating and designing culturally responsive projects for elementary and middle school programming classes. Our ultimate goal is to support K-8 teachers in effectively extracting suggestions from large language models by only using natural language modifications. Furthermore, we aim to develop a comprehensive assessment framework for culturally responsive AI-generated project ideas. We also hope to provide valuable insight into teachers’ perspectives on large language models and their integration into teaching practices.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in large language model-based generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have transformed computer science education, presenting both opportunities and challenges. A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

These benefits include helping students identify areas for improvement, develop a more accurate assessment of their own abilities, and improve their overall attitudes toward computer science.

abstract = {Since data science is traditionally an advanced field taught at the college or university level, introducing its concepts to K-12 students can present unique learning challenges. As educational environments increasingly adopt data science curricula for K-12 students, the need for scalable, personalized teaching tools becomes critical. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) in educational environments offers significant potential for scalability and automation, it is important to note that the generated language output may not always be highly suitable for K-12 students. In this paper, we introduce the DSRAG, a novel educational automatic feedback generation framework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cloud-based LLMs to provide automated and personalized feedback for K-12 students engaged in data science education. DSRAG employs Langchain question-answering and RAG systems to manage educational content and generate feedback on the top of GPT-4. We also demonstrate the framework's capability to simplify complex concepts and align its responses to be pedagogically appropriate and understandable for K-12 students.},

This study explores the implementation of AI-Lab, a framework designed to guide students in the effective and ethical use of generative AI, in this case ChatGPT, in academic settings without compromising skill development. Conducted during Spring 2024, our use of the intervention targeted over 500 Computer Science and Data Science majors enrolled in their major-specific Data Structures and Algorithms courses. The AI-Lab framework enabled students to develop both conceptual questions and c++ and Python programs by interacting with ChatGPT and iteratively correcting its errors. Focus groups and post-intervention surveys revealed a generally positive experience. Students appreciated the ability to leverage AI for tasks outside their major, recognizing the value of understanding correct solutions through AI-assisted programming. Moreover, the guided use of generative AI by professors alleviated concerns regarding academic dishonesty, fostering a supportive learning environment. Despite these benefits, students expressed awareness of the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on AI, noting the risk of impeding their professional growth. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the practical utility of AI for non-major related tasks. This study highlights the importance of incorporating structured AI training in curricula to balance skill development and ethical AI usage, offering insights for broader applications in higher education.},

abstract = {As generative AI increasingly integrates into society and education, the number of institutions implementing AI usage policies and offering introductory AI courses is rising. These introductory AI courses mustn't replicate the "gateway/weed-out" phenomenon observed in introductory computer science courses like CS1 and CS2. Literature in computer science education suggests that interventions such as summer camps, bridge courses, and socio-technical courses have improved the sense of belonging and retention among students from underrepresented groups, thereby broadening participation in computer science. Building on previous work to create a socio-technical curriculum for all ages and education levels, this paper presents a course for teaching introductory AI concepts that adopts a socio-technical approach, complete with weekly activities and content designed for broad access. The course has been taught as a 1-credit general education course, primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors, and a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels.This paper provides a curriculum and resources to teach a socio-technical introductory AI course. This approach is important because it not only democratizes AI education across diverse student backgrounds but also equips all students with the critical socio-technical multidisciplinary perspective necessary to navigate and shape the future ethical landscape of AI technology.},

In this study, we taught students about various GitHub Copilot features, including Copilot chat, in an upper-division software engineering course and asked students to add a feature to a large code base using Copilot. Our analysis revealed a novel interaction pattern that we call one-shot prompting, in which students ask Copilot to implement the entire feature at once and spend the next few prompts asking Copilot to debug the code or asking Copilot to regenerate its incorrect response. Finally, students reported significantly more trust in the code comprehension features than code generation features of Copilot, perhaps due to the presence of trust affordances in the Copilot chat that are absent in the code generation features. Our study takes the first steps in understanding how upper-division students use Github Copilot so that our instruction can adequately prepare students for a career in software engineering.},

The current program consists of 10 sessions, organized to serve TAs in three respective stages of professional development. The iterations involved updating and enrichment of the syllabus, transitioning from lecture-centered to discussion-centered training, and discussions of emerging topics in computing education such as the use of large language models (LLMs). Participant feedback showed that TAs approved the iterative design of the training, while identifying areas for further improvement. We summarize lessons learned from the iterative process, reflect on the role of peer TA trainers, and discuss plans for future iterations.},

In this paper, we investigate the real-world impact of this disagreement on final grades. Instead of focusing on individual answers, we simulate the grading process of an entire exam. We use an unmodified LLM (OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo) with one-shot prompting for grading individual answers to short answer questions from computer science courses at a German university. Our main contributions are the evaluation of the real-world impact on examination grades in contrast to correctness of individual student answers, the simulation of grading strategies common in human grading practice, and the discussion of the results in the context of observed inter-rater variabilities among human graders. The findings confirm the natural expectation that the impact of the disagreement is lower for final grades than when looking at individual answers. We quantify this effect and compare it to a grading obtained by simulating a second human grader.},

abstract = {Courses in computer science (CS) often assess student programming assignments manually, with the intent of providing in-depth feedback to each student regarding correctness, style, efficiency, and other quality attributes. As class sizes increase, however, it is hard to provide detailed feedback consistently, especially when multiple assessors are required to handle a larger number of assignment submissions. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising alternative to help automate this process in a consistent, scalable, and minimally-biased manner.This paper explores ChatGPT-4's scalablility and accuracy in assessing programming assignments based on predefined rubrics in the context of a case study we conducted in an upper-level undergraduate and graduate CS course at Vanderbilt University. In this case study, we employed a method that compared assessments generated by ChatGPT-4 against human graders to measure the accuracy, precision, and recall associated with identifying programming mistakes. Our results show that when ChatGPT-4 is used properly (e.g., with appropriate prompt engineering and feature selection) it can improve objectivity and grading efficiency, thereby acting as a complementary tool to human graders for advanced computer science graduate and undergraduate students.},

abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Processing and has transformed conversational tasks across various domains because of their widespread integration in applications and public access. The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study, we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure responsible and effective implementation.},

However, with the recent developments in generative AI, and especially the increasingly emerging popularity of ChatGPT, the effectiveness of using large language models for solving programming tasks has been underexplored. The present study examines ChatGPT’s ability to generate code solutions at different difficulty levels for introductory programming courses. We conducted an experiment where ChatGPT was tested on 127 randomly selected programming problems provided by Kattis, an automatic software grading tool for computer science programs, often used in higher education. The results showed that ChatGPT independently could solve 19 out of 127 programming tasks generated and assessed by Kattis. Further, ChatGPT was found to be able to generate accurate code solutions for simple problems but encountered difficulties with more complex programming tasks. The results contribute to the ongoing debate on the utility of AI-powered tools in programming education.},

Leveraging large language models (LLMs), CS50.ai offers a suite of AI-based tools that assist both students and instructors in mastering course material while overcoming the limitations posed by human resource constraints. This demo highlights how generative AI can be employed to conduct code reviews and pair-programming simulations, providing real-time feedback, code explanations, and collaborative programming insights. By integrating these AI tools into students' learning journeys, we aim to mimic the 1:1 interaction between instructor and student, improving both formative and summative assessments. We will showcase how these tools are implemented to scale personalized feedback, ensure academic integrity, and maintain pedagogical efficacy.

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

Presented here are the results from allowing students to use LLMs in the second course in a sequence of intensive introductory courses designed to prepare students with a non-computational background for entry into a masters' degree program. We allowed students to use the internet and LLMs (such as ChatGPT or Github Copilot) to help with assignments, with guidelines to avoid plagiarism and encourage learning. We then surveyed students to ask about how they used LLMs, whether they saw others cheating, how they generally used internet-based resources on assignments and exams, and their feedback on the policies. We found that students are overwhelmingly using LLMs (and the internet generally) to learn and code "better" rather than cheat. These results are intended to be a starting point to spark discussion on the adoption of new technologies in introductory computer science courses. The authors themselves will continue teaching courses with the policy that students should interact with an LLM the way they interact with a person: students are encouraged to discuss and collaborate with it, but copying code from it is considered plagiarism.},

abstract = {In higher education, introductory Computer Science (CS) programs offer a range of foundational courses. These encompass not only the standard CS1 and CS2 courses but may also include more specialized options like CS0 and CS1.5. In order to appropriately assign students to the suitable introductory courses, many institutions utilize placement tests, which assess students' pre-existing knowledge and skills. While most institutions rely on accuracy alone to make these determinations, there is often additional information concealed within the completed tests. This paper delves into the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to uncover this hidden information, particularly in gaining insights into how students perform in different concepts. Moreover, our framework has the flexibility to accommodate variations in curricula across different institutions, providing additional analytical perspectives. Initially, we built a concept inventory (CI) using the concepts covered in an institution's CS0, CS1, and CS2 curricula. Next, an LLM, specifically GPT 3.5, was applied to associate each question in the placement test with one or more concepts in the CI. Finally, the results of the placement tests were scrutinized, allowing the calculation of mastery levels in each concept for individual students. These mastery levels enable institutions to gauge a student's prior knowledge across various concepts simply by using a CS placement test. Additionally, we presented a case study demonstrating the application of this framework to 267 existing placement test results at Boston College.},

abstract = {The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 kickstarted the release of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) applications to the public domain. Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

However, running these LLMs traditionally requires access to advanced hardware resources and technical knowledge. To better provide a platform for experimenting with LLMs for users of all skill levels, we developed the Tufts Technology Services (TTS) LLM-Hub, a series of example Jupyter notebooks served through Tufts Open OnDemand (OOD) to setup, configure, and run LLMs automatically. The TTS LLM-Hub enabled quick access to running LLMs, while reducing barriers to compute and enabling users to chat with an LLM in just four clicks. We have used these platforms for support of advanced data science courses, and to enable research computing at Tufts.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT released by OpenAI, have attracted significant attention from both industry and academia due to their demonstrated ability to generate high-quality content for various tasks. Despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs, there are growing concerns regarding their potential risks in various fields, such as news, education, and software engineering. Recently, several commercial and open source LLM-generated content detectors have been proposed, which, however, are primarily designed for detecting natural language content without considering the specific characteristics of program code. This article aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel ChatGPT-generated code detector, CodeGPTSensor, based on a contrastive learning framework and a semantic encoder built with UniXcoder. To assess the effectiveness of CodeGPTSensor on differentiating ChatGPT-generated code from human-written code, we first curate a large-scale Human and Machine comparison Corpus (HMCorp), which includes 550k pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-generated code (i.e., 288k Python code pairs and 222k Java code pairs). Based on the HMCorp dataset, our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated code reveals the challenge and opportunity of distinguishing ChatGPT-generated code from human-written code with their representative features. Our experimental results indicate that CodeGPTSensor can effectively identify ChatGPT-generated code, outperforming all selected baselines.},

Our results suggest that only a minority of students engage with the chatbot in the courses that do not relate to LLMs. At the same time, unsurprisingly, nearly all students in the LLM-focused course leveraged the chatbot. In all courses, the majority of the chatbot usage came from a few superusers, whereas the majority of the students did not heavily use the chatbot even though it effectively provided free access to OpenAI's GPT-4 model (which would have otherwise required a paid subscription at the time of the study). We observe that in addition to students using the chatbot for course-specific purposes, many use the chatbot for their own purposes.  Overall, our results suggest that the worst fears of educators -- all students overrelying on chatbots -- did not materialize. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for low usage, including the need for more tailored and scaffolded chatbot experiences targeted for specific types of use cases.},

Findings reveal a positive association between the number of attempts and help requests, indicating more engaged students seek assistance. STM analysis shows high-ability students address abstract concepts early, while lower-ability students focus on syntax-related issues.

This study explores how large language models (LLMs) could assist in teaching this skill. While prior research has explored the use of LLMs in programming education, their precision and consistency in teaching code quality, particularly identifier selection, remains largely unexplored. For this purpose, this study investigated how well different LLMs can detect and report misleading identifiers. In a dataset of 33 code samples, we manually labeled misleading identifiers. On this dataset, we then tested five different LLMs on their ability to detect these misleading identifiers, measuring the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score. Results revealed that the most successful model, GPT-4o, was able to correctly detect most of the manually flagged misleading variable names. However, it also tended to flag issues with variable identifiers in cases where the human evaluators would not, and refined prompting was not able to discourage this behavior.},

abstract = {As AI-generated code promises to become an increasingly relied upon tool for software developers, there is a temptation to call for significant changes to early computer science curricula. A move from syntax-focused topics in CS1 toward abstraction and high-level application design seems motivated by the new large language models (LLMs) recently made available. In this position paper however, we advocate for an approach more informed by the AI itself - teaching early CS learners not only how to use the tools but also how to better understand them. Novice programmers leveraging AI-code-generation without proper understanding of syntax or logic can create "black box" code with significant security vulnerabilities. We outline methods for integrating basic AI knowledge and traditional software verification steps into CS1 along with LLMs, which will better prepare students for software development in professional settings.},

Therefore, recommendation frameworks play an important role and their usage is beneficial for a unification of education profiles in a systematic way. This  research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality. The results show that a formalization using GenAI has a high potential, but currently also shows deficits in the correctness of the resulting models, requiring human oversight during the model creation.},

We examine whether the release of LLMs like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, along with post-pandemic effects, has modified student interactions with autograders. Using data from student submissions over five years, totalling over 4,500 students across over 420,000 submissions, we analyze trends in submission behaviors before and after these events. Our methodology involves tracking submission patterns, focusing on timing, frequency, and score.Contrary to expectations, our findings reveal that metrics remain relatively consistent in the post-ChatGPT and post-pandemic era. Despite yearly fluctuations, no significant shift in student behaviors is attributable to these changes. Students continue to rely on a combination of manual debugging and autograder feedback without noticeable changes in their problem-solving approach.These findings highlight the resilience of the educational practices in these courses and suggest that integrating LLMs into mid-level CS curriculum may not necessitate the significant paradigm shift previously envisioned. Future work should extend these analyses to courses with different structures to determine if these results are generalizable. If not, the specific course aspects contributing to our observed ChatGPT and pandemic resilience should be identified.},

While research has explored effective meta-cognitive strategies to scaffold novice programmers' learning, it is essential to first understand and assess students' conceptual, procedural, and strategic/conditional programming knowledge at scale. To address this issue, we propose a three-model framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate, classify, and correct student responses to programming questions based on the SOLO Taxonomy. The SOLO Taxonomy provides a structured approach for categorizing student understanding into four levels: Pre-structural, Uni-structural, Multi-structural, and Relational. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieved high accuracy in generating and classifying responses for the Relational category, with moderate accuracy in the Uni-structural and Pre-structural categories, but struggled with the Multi-structural category. The model successfully corrected responses to the Relational level. Although further refinement is needed, these findings suggest that LLMs hold significant potential for supporting computer science education by assessing programming knowledge and guiding students toward deeper cognitive engagement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT. The pace of advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates the use of existing infrastructure to automate the evaluation of LLM performance on computing education tasks. Concept inventories are well suited for evaluation because of their careful design and prior validity evidence. OBJECTIVES. Our research explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework to evaluate computer science (CS) concept inventories. We explore three primary objectives: evaluation of LLM performance on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories; informal expert panel review of items which had variations between LLM and expected student performance; and description of challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation. METHOD. We used the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework to evaluate the SCS1 and BDSI against 10 LLMS with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning: GPT (3.5, 4.0), Claude (1.3, 2.0, 2.1), Llama (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral v0.1 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B. We used psychometric data from prior studies to measure knowledge levels for each LLM run. We then conducted an informal expert review to qualitatively explore how question design, CS content knowledge, and LLM design may explain differences between LLM and expected student performances. FINDINGS. Our quantitative analysis found that most LLM response patterns reflected a below average introductory computing student with the SCS1 and did not fit the psychometric 2PL model for the BDSI. Our qualitative analysis identified that LLMs performed well on code infill questions, but poorly on nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer questions. We also identified several methodological challenges related to item security, translation, the structure when using HELM. IMPLICATIONS. We consider the feasibility of using automated benchmarking as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous investigations to understand the intersection of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. We also consider connections between psychometric approaches and LLM evaluations to inform the design of computing assessments that are more resilient to LLM advancements.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

abstract = {The emergence of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT poses unprecedented risks of new types of plagiarism and cheating where students use LLMs to solve exercises for them. Detecting this behavior will be a necessary component in introductory computer science (CS1) courses, and educators should be well-equipped with detection tools when the need arises. However, ChatGPT generates code non-deterministically, and thus, traditional similarity detectors might not suffice to detect AI-created code. In this work, we explore the affordances of Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection task. We used an openly available dataset of student programs for CS1 assignments and had ChatGPT generate code for the same assignments, and then evaluated the performance of both traditional machine learning models and Abstract Syntax Tree-based (AST-based) deep learning models in detecting ChatGPT code from student code submissions. Our results suggest that both traditional machine learning models and AST-based deep learning models are effective in identifying ChatGPT-generated code with accuracy above 90%. Since the deployment of such models requires ML knowledge and resources that are not always accessible to instructors, we also explore the patterns detected by deep learning models that indicate possible ChatGPT code signatures, which instructors could possibly use to detect LLM-based cheating manually. We also explore whether explicitly asking ChatGPT to impersonate a novice programmer affects the code produced. We further discuss the potential applications of our proposed models for enhancing introductory computer science instruction.},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

abstract = {The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant debate, highlighting both their potential to augment student learning and the risks associated with their misuse. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, primarily focusing on evaluating the performance of existing models or conducting short-term human subject studies. However, very little work has examined the impacts of LLM-powered assistants on students in entry-level programming courses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To address this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study with 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our research team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the "CodeTutor group" as the experimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their final scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the "control group"). Within the CodeTutor group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered tools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their counterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding CodeTutor's capability to comprehend their queries and assist in learning programming language syntax. However, they had concerns about CodeTutor's limited role in developing critical thinking skills. Over the course of the semester, students' agreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for support from traditional human teaching assistants. Our findings also show that students turned to CodeTutor for different tasks, including programming task completion, syntax comprehension, and debugging, particularly seeking help for programming assignments. Our analysis further reveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with CodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon these results, we discuss the implications of our findings for the need to integrate Generative AI literacy into curricula to foster critical thinking skills, and turn to examining the temporal dynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the discrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual capabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve educational outcomes.},

Yet, the effectiveness of using static analysis (i.e., PMD) to detect coding issues, and relying on LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) to explain and recommend fix, has not yet been explored. In this talk, we aim to shed light on our experience in teaching the use of ChatGPT to cultivate a bugfix culture and leverage LLMs to improve software quality in educational settings.

Query languages are illustrated and tested through toy examples: small, accessible, instances of databases. These are not always engaging, but coming up with new examples and questions is time-consuming. Existing research in Computer Science Education has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate coding exercises. However, this has not been demonstrated for SQL yet but could save teachers much time. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to have ChatGPT-3.5 generate database schemas and associated SQL questions for teachers through a two-part study. Through a survey of educators, we found that creating a story and database schema for the SQL part is more time-consuming than the questions themselves. In our prompt engineering study, we identified prompts that were successful at creating database schemas, mock data, and exercises. However, although ChatGPT could help reduce the time required to create exams, some participants indicated that they are skeptical about using LLMs.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to write computer code. This ability can be quite beneficial when integrated into an IDE to assist a programmer with basic coding. On the other hand, it may be misused by computer science students for cheating on coding tests or homework assignments. At present, knowledge about the exact capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs is still inadequate. Furthermore, their capabilities have been changing quickly with each new release. In this paper, we present a dataset of 559 programming exercises in 10 programming languages collected from a system for evaluating coding assignments at our university. We have experimented with four well-known LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Codey, Code Llama) and asked them to solve these assignments. The evaluation results are intriguing and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models. In particular, GPT-4 (which performed the best) is currently capable of solving 55% of all our exercises and achieved an average score of 86% on exercises from the introductory programming course (using the best of five generated solutions).},

abstract = {The Artificial Intelligence Smart Classroom Initiative (ASCI) presents a re-imagined set of online course tools, designed primarily to support growing computer science classes. The system has four primary tools: an office hours queue, an automatic student grouping algorithm, a course-specific local large-language model (LLM), and administration tools for detecting students and TAs that need support. These tools interoperate to improve the quality of one another (e.g., LLM conversations support students directly in the office hours queue) and are enhanced by synchronizing data from multiple external sources such as Piazza, Gradescope, and Canvas. The system has been deployed in multiple courses over the past three semesters: initially as a FIFO queue, then supporting manual grouping and smart grouping of office hour attendees, and recently including LLM support. Preliminary results indicate that students who were grouped using the tool were more likely to return to the queue more than twice as often (on average) than those who were not. However, while grouping in office hours has the potential to decrease student wait times, teaching assistants and students tend to favor one-on-one meetings over group meetings. This might be improved in the future with updates to the software, TA training, and incorporation of other supporting tools (e.g., LLM technology). The other, newer, tools will be more thoroughly evaluated in future semesters.},

Prior work on similar AI models has shown that they perform well on typical intro-level Computer Science problems. However, little is known about the performance of such tools on Data Science (DS) problems. In this work, we assess the performance of ChatGPT on assignments from three DS courses with varying difficulty levels. First, we apply the raw assignment prompts provided to the students and find that ChatGPT performs well on assignments with dataset(s) descriptions and progressive question prompts, which divide the programming requirements into sub-problems. Then, we perform prompt engineering on the assignments for which ChatGPT had low performance. We find that the following prompt engineering techniques significantly increased ChatGPT's performance: breaking down abstract questions into steps, breaking down steps into multiple prompts, providing descriptions of the dataset(s), including algorithmic details, adding specific instructions to entice specific actions, and removing extraneous information. Finally, we discuss how our findings suggest potential changes to curriculum design of DS courses.},

abstract = {Undergraduate computer science and software engineering students benefit significantly from in-depth reviews of their code early and often in their courses. Performing these reviews is time-consuming for teaching assistants and professors to complete, consequently impacting the timeliness and consistency of the provided feedback. When code feedback is not delivered close to the time of authorship, the utility of the review for students is diminished. Prior work with Automatic Static Analysis Tools has shown promise at using artificial intelligence to automate code reviews, with some success integrating them into classroom environments. To leverage new advances in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models, this work reports on an Automatic Review Tool (ART) to provide timely, automatically generated code reviews. ART was evaluated in a second-semester computer science course by integrating ART into the course's Github-based assignment submission system. A cohort of student volunteers (N = 74) read the ART reviews and provided feedback using a survey spanning two of their course assignments. The results of this pilot study show that students perceived ART was successful at detecting defects and offering style-based suggestions, and students were receptive to receiving future automated reviews of their work.},

abstract = {A scientific disciplinary assessment system is crucial for nurturing high-quality disciplines within Computer Science. Computer Science Education (CSE) emphasizes the need for a scientific and comprehensive assessment method that guides the development of the discipline, with a particular focus on practical contributions. However, traditional assessment systems tend to prioritize the theoretical outcomes. Moreover, data expansion demands significant effort and time from educational professionals, making it challenging to conduct a thorough evaluation of the disciplines. To tackle these issues, we introduce a data-driven, contribution-based disciplinary assessment system. This system takes into account both theoretical and practical contributions to provide a holistic evaluation. Our proposed system employs a contribution-based assessment approach to establish a correct evaluative direction, steering discipline construction to align with societal needs. It also incorporates intelligent algorithms and a Large Language Model (LLM), leveraging their substantial computational power in the evaluation process. This integration alleviates the workload of educational professionals by automating the collection and analysis of information. The paper outlines a detailed implementation plan that integrates contribution evaluation theory with intelligent technologies, aiming to foster the ongoing advancement of CSE education.},

This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently taken many fields, including computer science, by storm. Most recent work on LLMs in computing education has shown that they are capable of solving most introductory programming (CS1) exercises, exam questions, Parsons problems, and several other types of exercises and questions. Some work has investigated the ability of LLMs to solve CS2 problems as well. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs fare against more advanced upper-division coursework, such as proofs in algorithms courses. After all, while known to be proficient in many programming tasks, LLMs have been shown to have more difficulties in forming mathematical proofs.In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to solve mathematical proofs by using Proof Blocks, a tool previously shown to efficaciously teach proofs to students. Our results show that GPT-3.5 is almost completely unable to provide correct solutions (11.4%), while GPT-4 shows a significant increase in correctness (64.8%). However, even given this improvement, current models still struggle to correctly order lines in a proof. It remains an open question whether this is a temporary situation or if LLMs will continue to struggle to solve these types of exercises in the future.},

abstract = {The integration of large language models (LLMs) into computing education offers many potential benefits to student learning, and several novel pedagogical approaches have been reported in the literature. However LLMs also present challenges, one of the most commonly cited being that of student over-reliance. This challenge is compounded by the fact that LLMs are always available to provide instant help and solutions to students, which can undermine their ability to independently solve problems and diagnose and resolve errors. Providing instructor oversight of LLM-generated content can mitigate this problem, however it is often not practical in real-time learning contexts. Online class discussion forums, which are widely used in computing education, present an opportunity for exploring instructor oversight because they operate asynchronously. Unlike real-time interactions, the discussion forum format aligns with the expectation that responses may take time, making oversight not only feasible but also pedagogically appropriate. In this practitioner paper, we present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a ‘bot’ module that is controlled by the instructor, and integrated into an online discussion forum. The bot assists the instructor by generating draft responses to student questions, which are reviewed, modified, and approved before release. Key features include the ability to leverage course materials, access archived discussions, and publish responses anonymously to encourage open participation. We report our experiences using this tool in a 12-week second-year software engineering course on object-oriented programming. Instructor feedback confirmed the tool successfully alleviated workload but highlighted a need for improvement in handling complex, context-dependent queries. We report the features that were viewed as most beneficial, and suggest avenues for future exploration.},

abstract = {This position paper discusses the potential for using generative AIs like ChatGPT in software engineering education. Currently, discussions center around potential threats emerging from student's use of ChatGPT. For instance, generative AI will limit the usefulness of graded homework dramatically. However, there exist potential opportunities as well. For example, ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human language allows providing personalized feedback to students, and can thus accompany current software engineering education approaches. This paper highlights the potential for enhancing software engineering education. The availability of generative AI will improve the individualization of education approaches. In addition, we discuss the need to adapt software engineering curricula to the changed profiles of software engineers. Moreover, we point out why it is important to provide guidance for using generative AI and, thus, integrate it in courses rather than accepting the unsupervised use by students, which can negatively impact the students' learning.},

Recent educational initiatives have focused on enhancing CS and engineering students' AI ethics education but have largely overlooked integrating these concepts across other disciplines. This paper presents and assesses a pioneering initiative that integrates AI ethics into university curricula through a collaborative framework between CS and domain educators. We introduced 1-3 week AI ethics modules in seven diverse courses from Art to Chemistry, incorporating case studies and hands-on activities using chat- or image-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Student surveys indicated significant gains in confidence regarding AI ethics discussions, application of principles, and reasoning skills. Our approach advocates for utilizing structured frameworks and faculty collaboration in embedding AI ethics into university curricula, enhancing students' practical skills and ethical understanding across diverse professional settings.},

abstract = {The recent, widespread availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot may impact introductory programming courses (CS1) both in terms of what should be taught and how to teach it. Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.},

In four different tech events, several example scenarios of how a tech-savvy engineer could use ChatGPT to prototype apps in unfamiliar programming languages were demonstrated, including a health education app. The four events include an IEEE chapter workshop, an IEEE WIE (Woman In Engineering) meeting, an IEEE joint chapter talk, and a university-level Computer Science class. The responses from the tech audience showed that the majority perceived value in the use of LLM chatbots in these contexts, even though there were subtle differences among different groups. This shows the need for further research on how to effectively incorporate LLM chatbots into traditional software design workflow to better serve the software development community.},

With N=86 students, this course implemented a policy that promotes responsible AI use through guidelines and an "AI-usage disclosure" form for coursework submissions. This approach sought to improve AI literacy, ensure academic integrity, and mitigate potential academic misconduct cases. Despite challenges, including adherence to AI disclosures and the evolving definition of AI tools, the policy promoted a more inclusive learning environment and encouraged a deeper understanding of AI’s role and limitations in computer science education. The findings highlight the need for ongoing policy revisions to adapt to technological advancements, emphasizing the pilot as an essential step towards integrating AI responsibly in educational contexts.},

abstract = {The recent integration of visual capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to play a pivotal role in science and technology education, where visual elements such as diagrams, charts, and tables are commonly used to improve the learning experience. This study investigates the performance of ChatGPT-4 Vision, OpenAI’s most advanced visual model at the time the study was conducted, on the Bachelor in Computer Science section of Brazil’s 2021 National Undergraduate Exam (ENADE). By presenting the model with the exam’s open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model’s reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile. While it excelled in questions that incorporated visual elements, it also encountered challenges with question interpretation, logical reasoning, and visual acuity. A positive correlation between the model’s performance in multiple-choice questions and the performance distribution of the human participants suggests multimodal LLMs can provide a useful tool for question testing and refinement. However, the involvement of an independent expert panel to review cases of disagreement between the model and the answer key revealed some poorly constructed questions containing vague or ambiguous statements, calling attention to the critical need for improved question design in future exams. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4 Vision shows promise in multimodal academic evaluations, human oversight remains crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy and ensuring the fairness of high-stakes educational exams.

abstract = {Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student’s code submission passes each test case and 2) the student’s open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.},

abstract = {Programming skills are typically developed through completing various hands-on exercises. Such programming problems can be contextualized to students’ interests and cultural backgrounds. Prior research in educational psychology has demonstrated that context personalization of exercises stimulates learners’ situational interests and positively affects their engagement. However, creating a varied and comprehensive set of programming exercises for students to practice on is a time-consuming and laborious task for computer science educators. Previous studies have shown that large language models can generate conceptually and contextually relevant programming exercises. Thus, they offer a possibility to automatically produce personalized programming problems to fit students’ interests and needs. This article reports on a user study conducted in an elective introductory programming course that included contextually personalized programming exercises created with GPT-4. The quality of the exercises was evaluated by both the students and the authors. Additionally, this work investigated student attitudes towards the created exercises and their engagement with the system. The results demonstrate that the quality of exercises generated with GPT-4 was generally high. What is more, the course participants found them engaging and useful. This suggests that AI-generated programming problems can be a worthwhile addition to introductory programming courses, as they provide students with a practically unlimited pool of practice material tailored to their personal interests and educational needs.},

abstract = {Computer science (CS) programs have a variety of reasons for regularly reviewing and revising the curriculum for their undergraduate major. Some of these stem from the rapid pace of change in the discipline and corresponding changes in industry expectations for CS graduates. This has been most recently seen as departments consider how to adjust to advances in generative AI and respond to new international curricular guidelines in the form of CS2023 [1]. Programs also revise their CS major in response to contextual shifts at their institution, such as changes in the size and makeup of the student body, the resources and staffing of a program, assessment results, or new institutional priorities [6]. A shifting student body may come with changes in prior experience with computing and in the professional goals of the students. For smaller programs, staffing changes often affect the balance of expertise within subareas of CS. New institutional priorities such as enabling more study abroad experiences or embedding internship/service-learning into the curriculum can require majors to adjust to both accommodate and support these priorities.},

abstract = {Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.},

We found the number of average IWFs per MCQ ranged from 1.6 (rule-based verification) to 2.18 (LLM-based). Among the most frequently identified MCQ flaws were lack of enough context (17%) or answer choices with at least one implausible distractor (57%). Both human and automated assessment identified implausible distractors as one of the most frequent flaw categories. Results from our human annotation study were generally more positive (51--65% good items) compared to our automated assessment study results, which tended toward greater flaw identification (15--25% good items), depending on evaluation method.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems have experienced exponential growth in the last couple of years. These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

abstract = {ChatGPT is the front end to a powerful large language model that has garnered widespread attention in many fields of study, including computer science (CS), where it promises to be transformational. As educators, we are just starting to grapple with the ramifications of this new technology, including implications for what we teach, how we teach, and how we grade. The decisions educators make moving forward depend heavily on the prevalence of students' use (and misuse) of ChatGPT in the classroom. Further, predictors of nefarious use could aid educators as well. We conducted an online survey to capture CS student awareness of, experience with, and attitudes toward ChatGPT. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that awareness of ChatGPT is generally high, and it is more frequently being used as a study tool than to complete students' work for them. Most students are aware of the potential for abuse in academic pursuits, but a notable minority of students admit to using it unscrupulously and to the potential for it to interfere with their learning. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider as educators modify their approaches and develop guidelines for ChatGPT usage in their classrooms.},

abstract = {This study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) by undergraduate and graduate students for programming assignments in advanced computing classes. Unlike existing research, which primarily focuses on introductory classes and lacks in-depth analysis of actual student-LLM interactions, our work fills this gap. We conducted a comprehensive analysis involving 411 students from a Distributed Systems class at an Indian university, where they completed three programming assignments and shared their experiences through Google Form surveys and interviews.Our findings reveal that students leveraged LLMs for a variety of tasks, including code generation, debugging, conceptual inquiries, and test case creation. They employed a spectrum of prompting strategies, ranging from basic contextual prompts to advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative refinement. While students generally viewed LLMs as beneficial for enhancing productivity and learning, we noted a concerning trend of over-reliance, with many students submitting entire assignment descriptions to obtain complete solutions. Given the increasing use of LLMs in the software industry, our study highlights the need to update undergraduate curricula to include training on effective prompting strategies and to raise awareness about the benefits and potential drawbacks of LLM usage in academic settings.},

abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) started a serious discussion among educators on how LLMs would affect, e.g., curricula, assessments, and students' competencies. Generative AI and LLMs also raised ethical questions and concerns for computing educators and professionals.This experience report presents an assignment within a course on professional competencies, including some related to ethics, that computing master's students need in their careers. For the assignment, student groups discussed the ethical process by Lennerfors et al. by analyzing a case: a fictional researcher considers whether to attend the real CHI 2024 conference in Hawaii. The tasks were (1) to participate in in-class discussions on the case, (2) to use an LLM of their choice as a discussion partner for said case, and (3) to document both discussions, reflecting on their use of the LLM.Students reported positive experiences with the LLM as a way to increase their knowledge and understanding, although some identified limitations. The LLM provided a wider set of options for action in the studied case, including unfeasible ones. The LLM would not select a course of action, so students had to choose themselves, which they saw as coherent.From the educators' perspective, there is a need for more instruction for students using LLMs: some students did not perceive the tools as such but rather as an authoritative knowledge base. Therefore, this work has implications for educators considering the use of LLMs as discussion partners or tools to practice critical thinking, especially in computing ethics education.},

abstract = {Natural language processing has taken enormous steps during the last few years. The development of large language models and generative AI has elevated natural language processing to the level that it can output coherent and contextually relevant text for a given natural language prompt. ChatGPT is one incarnation of these steps, and its use in education is a rather new phenomenon. In this paper, we study students’ perception on ChatGPT during a computer science course. On the course, we integrated ChatGPT into Teams private discussion groups. In addition, all the students had freedom to employ ChatGPT and related technologies to help them in their coursework. The results show that the majority of students had at least tested AI-powered chatbots, and that students are using AI-powered chatbots for multiple tasks, e.g., debugging code, tutoring, and enhancing comprehension. The amount of positive implications of using ChatGPT takes over the negative implications, when the implications were considered from an understanding, learning and creativity perspective. Relatively many students reported reliability issues with the outputs and that the iterations with prompts might be necessary for satisfactory outputs. It is important to try to steer the usage of ChatGPT so that it complements students’ learning processes, but does not replace it.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) generative tools, commonly referred to as AI-based tools, have become integral in various computing domains, including education. The widespread adoption of these tools has raised concerns among educators, spanning from issues related to plagiarism and comprehension gaps to potential threats to student identity. Consequently, educators are grappling with how to adapt their courses and incorporate AI technologies into their curriculum and pedagogical approaches. In addition to navigating challenges associated with AI regulations, educators face the compounded difficulty of addressing post-pandemic issues, such as students displaying diminished effort and professionalism in the classroom. The convergence of these two challenges creates a complex scenario that intertwines technical and professional considerations. Within the Computer Science Fundamentals course, commonly referred to as CS 1, the learning process revolves around comprehending programming through a sequential understanding of steps, as each concept builds upon the preceding one. This investigation centers on the CS 1 curriculum within an American two-year program, commonly known as a community college. The objective is to address a problem by leveraging an AI tool within team settings. The study assesses both problem-solving capabilities and the effectiveness of teamwork, providing recommendations to guide students in the proper utilization of AI tools. The emphasis is on fostering contextual relevance and collaborative work within the generative learning process.},

abstract = {Learning to program requires the development of a variety of skills including the ability to read, comprehend, and communicate the purpose of code. In the age of large language models (LLMs), where code can be generated automatically, developing these skills is more important than ever for novice programmers. The ability to write precise natural language descriptions of desired behavior is essential for eliciting code from an LLM, and the code that is generated must be understood in order to evaluate its correctness and suitability. In introductory computer science courses, a common question type used to develop and assess code comprehension skill is the 'Explain in Plain English' (EiPE) question. In these questions, students are shown a segment of code and asked to provide a natural language description of that code's purpose. The adoption of EiPE questions at scale has been hindered by: 1) the difficulty of automatically grading short answer responses and 2) the ability to provide effective and transparent feedback to students. To address these shortcomings, we explore and evaluate a grading approach where a student's EiPE response is used to generate code via an LLM, and that code is evaluated against test cases to determine if the description of the code was accurate. This provides a scalable approach to creating code comprehension questions and enables feedback both through the code generated from a student's description and the results of test cases run on that code. We evaluate students' success in completing these tasks, their use of the feedback provided by the system, and their perceptions of the activity.},

abstract = {Self-reflection on learning experiences constitutes a fundamental cognitive process, essential for consolidating knowledge and enhancing learning efficacy. However, traditional methods to facilitate reflection often face challenges in personalization, immediacy of feedback, engagement, and scalability. Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the reflection process could mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we conducted two randomized field experiments in undergraduate computer science courses to investigate the potential of LLMs to help students engage in post-lesson reflection. In the first experiment (N=145), students completed a take-home assignment with the support of an LLM assistant; half of these students were then provided access to an LLM designed to facilitate self-reflection. The results indicated that the students assigned to LLM-guided reflection reported somewhat increased self-confidence compared to peers in a no-reflection control and a non-significant trend towards higher scores on a later assessment. Thematic analysis of students' interactions with the LLM showed that the LLM often affirmed the student's understanding, expanded on the student's reflection, and prompted additional reflection; these behaviors suggest ways LLM-interaction might facilitate reflection. In the second experiment (N=112), we evaluated the impact of LLM-guided self-reflection against other scalable reflection methods, such as questionnaire-based activities and review of key lecture slides, after assignment. Our findings suggest that the students in the questionnaire and LLM-based reflection groups performed equally well and better than those who were only exposed to lecture slides, according to their scores on a proctored exam two weeks later on the same subject matter. These results underscore the utility of LLM-guided reflection and questionnaire-based activities in improving learning outcomes. Our work highlights that focusing solely on the accuracy of LLMs can overlook their potential to enhance metacognitive skills through practices such as self-reflection. We discuss the implications of our research for the learning-at-scale community, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance learning experiences through personalized, engaging, and scalable reflection practices.},

abstract = {In the United States, culturally relevant computing (CRC) is one of the most popular pedagogical implementations for Latin American (Latine) students. Culturally-relevant learning resources are a valuable tool for implementing CRC. However, the traditional method of creation and maintenance of textbooks takes a significant amount of time and effort. Given the duration required for textbook production, the development of culturally-relevant learning resources may become lengthened, as it requires close attention both on the material and the incorporation of cultural referents. In order to accelerate the process, we used the advancement of large language models (LLMs) to our advantage. Through prompt engineering, we created a series of prompts to produce a textbook for an introductory computer science course (CS1) that incorporates Latine culture. This textbook was evaluated on metrics regarding sensibility, correctness, readability, linguistic approachability, appropriateness of examples, and cultural relevance. Overall, the generated textbook was mainly sensible, correct, readable, and linguistically approachable. Code examples were not always appropriate due to the usage of libraries that are not typically used in a CS1 course. The cultural relevance was apparent, but it often included surface-level cultural referents. The main incorporation of culture was through geographical locations and people's names. This suggests that the use of LLMs to generate textbooks may serve as a valuable first step for writing culturally-relevant learning resources. Though this study focuses on Latines, our results and prompts may be applicable for generating culturally-relevant CS1 textbooks for other cultures.},

abstract = {Despite the exponential growth in demand for advanced computational skills driven by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, higher education institutions still face a significant shortage of dedicated course offerings pertaining to High Performance Computing (HPC). This educational deficiency not only hampers the preparedness of undergraduate students for cutting-edge postgraduate programs but also impairs their readiness to enter a dynamic workforce increasingly reliant on sophisticated computational capabilities. Integrating comprehensive HPC courses at the undergraduate level is critical for equipping students with expertise to effectively utilize modern computing technologies, and also for bridging the growing gap between academic preparation and industry demands. At Wake Forest University (WFU), we, members of the HPC Team, are actively working to address the educational gap in HPC by integrating the WFU HPC Facility[4] into higher-level elective courses across various disciplines. Recognizing the foundational importance of these skills, we have developed an introductory course specifically designed to equip students with the knowledge to excel in advanced courses, in graduate and research programs, and to meet the demands of the modern workforce. By integrating the WFU HPC Facility into our curriculum, the University is committed to pioneering a comprehensive educational pathway that empowers students to leverage the full potential of computing technologies in their future careers. WFU is an R-2 liberal arts institution with around 9,000 students[6] that actively supports undergraduate research through a multitude of departments and programs. Undergraduate research is so paramount to the University mission, that WFU has a dedicated center, the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) Center, just for this purpose. Many students engage in research projects that leverage the resources of the WFU HPC Facility. The facility’s main asset, the Distributed Environment for Academic Computing (DEAC) Cluster, contains approximately 4000 CPU cores and 20TB of RAM, and is a true interdisciplinary tool; in 2023 it was utilized by 15 departments and 500 active users to submit over 1.5 million computational tasks on a vast array of research topics. The interdisciplinary nature of the DEAC Cluster played an instrumental role in developing an introductory course in HPC that caters to students from a diverse number of majors. Having supported a wide range of researchers, we designed the course to bridge concepts and applications from Computer Science, Engineering, Data Science, and the Natural Sciences to their respective academic domains. By enabling students from multiple disciplines to access foundational HPC skills, we foster a versatile educational environment where collaborative and interdisciplinary learning thrives. One way that we ensure our introductory course is accessible to all students is that we do not require any prerequisite classes to enroll in the course. Students are also not expected to have any prior experience in programming. We have chosen Python as the primary programming language for the course, as it is one of the most versatile and widely-used languages in the fields of data science and machine learning, and can easily interface with parallel frameworks such as MPI and OpenMP. Students gain hands-on experience by developing asynchronous workflows, which are then executed on the DEAC Cluster. This practical focus not only demystifies complex computational concepts but also empowers students to apply their learning in real-world scenarios. HPC serves as a cornerstone for two distinct user groups, each integral to its advancement and application. The first encompasses those who enable and optimize HPC systems, including Computer Scientists, Computer Engineers, Systems Administrators, and Cyberinfrastructure Professionals, who enhance computational efficiency and build the underlying hardware infrastructure. The second group comprises scientists and researchers across diverse fields such as Statistics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Engineering, and more, who leverage HPC as a powerful tool for simulating complex phenomena, analyzing large datasets, and researching novel problems in their respective domains. While current course offerings at other institutions seem to prioritize the first group and educate students on how to build and enable an HPC cluster, we have chosen to prioritize curriculum for the second group as the skills they gain through our course’s curriculum will help them as they continue their academic career in higher level electives and independent research projects with faculty advisors. We choose to offer our course during the Spring semester in order to prepare students who may want to pursue research during the summer session. The first half of the course serves as foundational cluster training, familiarizing students with essential skills to work within an HPC environment. In this segment, students delve into the Linux command line interface (CLI) using Bashcrawl[3] and explore the intricacies of the Linux filesystem and environment modules. A significant focus is placed on understanding and utilizing job schedulers, such as the Slurm resource manager[2]. Another unique feature of this segment is the guided tour of the Wake Forest datacenter. This tour provides students with a tangible understanding of how the theoretical concepts discussed in class are implemented in a real-world HPC cluster. To further provide a reference to the resources requested for their jobs through Slurm, the tour concludes with students disassembling retired compute nodes to learn about the different components that comprise modern servers. The midterm assessment challenges students to submit multiple jobs, analyzing the effects of varying input sizes and the use of multiple CPU processors on calculation speed. Upon completion of this initial phase, students are fully equipped to engage in research activities under an advisor and effectively utilize an HPC cluster outside the confines of the classroom. Many apply for summer grants through the aforementioned URECA program with a faculty advisor. In the latter half of the course, the curriculum shifts towards more advanced topics, focusing on parallel computing frameworks and technologies. Students are introduced to MPI and OpenMP, which are essential for developing parallel applications that can run efficiently on today’s multi-processor systems. Additionally, the course delves into high-speed interconnects, crucial for optimizing communication between different parts of an HPC cluster. One of our final topics covers GPU computing, with a particular emphasis on using NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA programming platform, enabling students to harness the power of graphical processing for computational tasks. As an example from our Spring 2024 semester, students built a “chatbot” using Meta’s Llama 2 model[5] on both CPU and GPU using LLaMA C++[1], and compared its performance to ChatGPT while interacting freely with it. Our course is designed to complement other specialized courses found in Computer Science or in Computer Engineering programs, such as Parallel Algorithms, Computer Vision, or Deep Learning. It aims to introduce these critical computational concepts and provide a solid foundation that prepares students for these more advanced electives. By the end of the course, students are not only familiar with the basic principles of HPC but are also primed to tackle more specialized studies and research in their future academic and professional pursuits. It is not uncommon that a course may require students to use a specific programming language or software. While there are tools such as Google Colab and zyBooks that provide a browser-based interface to computing resources, those tools can be very limited in what resources they can provide. A faculty member might then want students to install software locally on their laptop, but this can be challenging when students bring their own device to the classroom as they may be running different operating systems or may have different hardware platforms. This can cause the software to behave differently or it may not even be available on that given platform. Courses with significant computational demands are better served utilizing a unified computing environment, and an HPC facility is ideally equipped to provide a consistent learning environment where each student has access to the same software and computing resources. A primary challenge in integrating HPC resources into coursework is instructing students on the use of schedulers for asynchronous workloads. Our introductory HPC course effectively bridges this gap by providing the necessary training and context, enabling students to engage with advanced topics more efficiently, without the steep initial learning curve typically associated with these environments. Our HPC facility has proven instrumental in enhancing educational experiences across a variety of disciplines, demonstrating significant benefits in classes such as Statistics, Natural Language Processing, Parallel Algorithms, Computer Vision, Physics Laboratory, Cancer Biology, Environmental Physics, Computational Modeling, and more. Moreover, students in fields like Finance and Business and Enterprise Management have also successfully leveraged our HPC resources, and have performed analysis on client data that was protected under a nondisclosure agreement which prevented students from storing the data locally on their laptop or with commercial cloud providers. This integration not only facilitates sophisticated computational tasks, but also allows students and faculty to easily share and store large datasets that the students may need to access without having to consume space on their local device. One of our primary goals is to promote diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration within this course, and this semester attracted a notably diverse group of students, with majors ranging from Biology and Statistics to Applied Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. Although the course is currently catalogued under the Computer Science department, we recognize that associating it with any single discipline could potentially limit its appeal and accessibility. The diverse enrollment underscores the interdisciplinary relevance of HPC skills across various fields of study. We are leveraging the current success and broad interest in the course as a foundation to establish a new academic program dedicated to High Performance Computing. This new program will serve as a hub for integrating computational skills across different disciplines, fostering a broader understanding and application of HPC in various scientific and economic sectors. The HPC team’s commitment to High Performance Computing education extends beyond traditional academic structures. While we are not developing a new major, minor, certificate track, or concentration in HPC, our objective is to make HPC education accessible and applicable across various disciplines without the constraints of a single departmental bias. This approach allows students from any field to engage with HPC skills as an integral part of their academic and professional development. To achieve this, we are actively collaborating with multiple academic departments to ensure that our HPC course offerings are recognized as fulfilling degree requirements across a range of programs. One way we collaborate with these departments is by altering activities and projects to use different languages and software, such as R and MATLAB, for the Statistics and Engineering departments, while still maintaining the same learning goals we achieve with Python. This strategy not only enhances the versatility of our course but also promotes a more comprehensive integration of the university’s HPC facilities into the curriculum. By doing so, we allow faculty in different departments to integrate our projects into their courses and utilize our HPC facility, even if it is for only one or two projects throughout the semester. Our efforts are focused on fostering a collaborative academic environment where the HPC facility is not just an isolated resource used for research but a central part of our educational infrastructure. By working across disciplines, we hope to catalyze a deeper engagement with HPC technologies throughout the university, enhancing both teaching and research capacities across departments. In conclusion, the escalating demand for big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is not only transforming industries but also reshaping educational requirements. As these fields expand, the need for substantial computational resources becomes increasingly critical. The HPC facility at Wake Forest University is exceptionally well-equipped to meet these demands, by providing a unified computing environment that supports an array of academic endeavors. Our initiative to develop introductory HPC courses is a strategic response to this need, preparing students to proficiently utilize HPC resources in higher-level electives and beyond. These courses are pivotal in bridging the gap between conventional academic programs and the rigorous computational needs of modern disciplines. Looking forward, the necessity for such educational offerings will only intensify as the reliance on advanced computational technologies grows. By anticipating and responding to these educational demands, Wake Forest University’s HPC academic program not only enhances student readiness for future challenges but also positions the university at the forefront of academic innovation in the computational sciences.},

abstract = {Teaching computer science at scale can be challenging. From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

AIDEs are programming tools that, given comments or starter code, can generate code solution suggestions. As the accuracy of these tools continues to increase, one particular AIDE from Github, Copilot, has been gaining significant attention for its performance and ease of use. The rise of Copilot suggests that code solution generation tools will soon be commonplace in both the industry and in computer science courses, with expert and novice programmers alike benefiting from using these tools. More specifically for novices, the effects of Copilot on the process of learning to code are mostly unknown. In this paper, we perform initial explorations into these effects. Using introductory computer science and data science courses, we evaluate Copilot-generated programming assignment solutions for correctness, style, skill level appropriateness, grade scores, and potential plagiarism. Our findings indicate Copilot generates mostly unique code that can solve introductory assignments with human-graded scores ranging from 68% to 95%. Based on these results, we provide recommendations for educators to help adapt their courses to incorporate new AIDE-based programming workflows.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students’ usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.},

abstract = {There is a great need for data in computing education research. Data is needed to understand how students behave, to train models of student behavior to optimally support students, and to develop and validate new assessment tools and learning analytics techniques. However, relatively few computing education datasets are shared openly, often due to privacy regulations and issues in making sure the data is anonymous. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to create large-scale, privacy-preserving synthetic data, which can be used to explore various aspects of student learning, develop and test educational technologies, and support research in areas where collecting real student data may be challenging or impractical. This work explores generating synthetic buggy code submissions for introductory programming exercises using GPT-4o. We compare the distribution of test case failures between synthetic and real student data from two courses to analyze the accuracy of the synthetic data in mimicking real student data. Our findings suggest that LLMs can be used to generate synthetic incorrect submissions that are not significantly different from real student data with regard to test case failure distributions. Our research contributes to the development of reliable synthetic datasets for computing education research and teaching, potentially accelerating progress in the field while preserving student privacy.},

abstract = {Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students’ use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course&nbsp;(n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools.},

abstract = {Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT&nbsp;[8] and GPT-4&nbsp;[9] could enhance programming education in various roles, e.g., by acting as a personalized digital tutor for a student, a digital assistant for an educator, and a digital peer for collaborative learning&nbsp;[1, 2, 7]. In our work, we seek to comprehensively evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art large language models for various scenarios in programming education. Recent works have evaluated several large language models in the context of programming education&nbsp;[4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org &nbsp;[5] (see Figure&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

In the pre-GPT era, we successfully applied oral and open-book home exams for two courses in the third year of our predominantly remote Software Engineering BSc program. We ask in this paper whether our current open-book exams are still viable or whether a move back to a legally compliant but less scalable oral exam is the only workable alternative. We further compare work-effort estimates between oral and open-book exams and report on differences in throughput and grade distribution over eight years to better understand the impact of examination format on the outcome. Examining GPT-4 on the most recent open-book exams showed that our current Artificial Intelligence and Reactive Programming exams are not GPT v4 proof. Three potential weaknesses of GPT are outlined. We also found that grade distributions have largely been unaffected by the examination format, opening up for a move to oral examinations only if needed. Throughput was higher for open-book exam course instances (73% vs 64%), while fail rates were too (12% vs 7%), with teacher workload increasing even for smaller classes. We also report on our experience regarding effort. Oral examinations are efficient for smaller groups but come with caveats regarding intensity and stress.},

While there is a growing body of research in computing education on utilizing large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) in generation and engagement with coding exercises, the use of LLMs for generating programming MCQs has not been extensively explored. We analyzed the capability of GPT-4 to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) aligned with specific learning objectives (LOs) from Python programming classes in higher education. Specifically, we developed an LLM-powered (GPT-4) system for generation of MCQs from high-level course context and module-level LOs. We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be well-aligned with the LOs. Our findings can be leveraged by educators wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support MCQ authoring efforts.},

abstract = {Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs. By training a black box machine learning model and “explaining” its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks. However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes. In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models. By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code. We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects. Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans. Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT’s explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%). Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.},

Since the majority of the exercises in these tools' training dataset are written in English, it is also unclear how well they function with exercises published in other languages.In this paper, we report our experience using GPT-3 to solve 6 real-world tasks used in an Object Oriented Programming course at a Portuguese University and written in Portuguese. Our observations, based on an objective evaluation of the code, performed by an open-source Automatic Assessment Tool, show that GPT-3 is able to interpret and handle direct functional requirements, however it tends not to give the best solution in terms of object oriented design. We perform a qualitative analysis of GPT-3's output, and gather a set of recommendations for computer science educators, since we expect students to use and abuse this tool in their academic work.},

However, the release of ChatGPT and other free-to-use generative AI tools has provided a new and distinct method for cheating. Students can run many assessment questions through the tool and generate a superficially compelling answer, which may or may not be accurate.&nbsp;We ran a dual-anonymous “quality assurance” marking exercise across four end-of-module assessments across a distance university computer science (CS) curriculum. Each marker received five ChatGPT-generated scripts alongside 10 student scripts. A total of 90 scripts were marked; every ChatGPT-generated script for the undergraduate modules received at least a passing grade (&gt;40%), with all of the introductory module CS1 scripts receiving a distinction (&gt;85%). None of the ChatGPT-taught postgraduate scripts received a passing grade (&gt;50%). We also present the results of interviewing the markers and of running our sample scripts through a GPT-2 detector and the TurnItIn AI detector, which both identified every ChatGPT-generated script but differed in the number of false positives. As such, we contribute a baseline understanding of how the public release of generative AI is likely to significantly impact quality assurance processes. Our analysis demonstrates that in most cases, across a range of question formats, topics, and study levels, ChatGPT is at least capable of producing adequate answers for undergraduate assessment.},

abstract = {Self-regulation refers to the ability to plan, monitor, control and reflect on one's problem-solving process. Prior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve novice performance in solving programming problems. However, with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process.On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design new interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework that incorporates use of generative AI tools in programming problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides exploration of the design space of interventions that integrate generative AI in CS education.},

abstract = {Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life, many opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence. Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a specific area: responding to student programmers’ help requests. More specifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic code that students request help on. Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online programming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and GPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students’ code and assessed the LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently find at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90% of the cases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57% of the time). False positives are common (40% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice that the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better on issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model solutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM responses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than responses to English prompts. Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in programming education. At the same time, the results highlight the unreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do, perhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment systems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future efforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.},

[4] in 2021, maps into the DHS/NSA KUs supporting the CAE-CD designation, from two aspects: E-voting principle based topics, i.e., from theory and a plug-and-play e-voting system's composing components, i.e., from practice. We grouped CAE-CD KUs into those required as prerequisites, closely related, related/supported, and not covered by the E-voting curriculum. Teachers can then choose which KUs they will use and teach using only the parts of the E-voting-oriented curriculum they deem relevant, and in a depth they find appropriate to their educational objectives, while meeting the requirements of the selected KUs. We conclude with a discussion of how LLMs (Large Language Models) and quantum computing might be added to the E-voting-oriented curriculum.},

Effectively implementing a large language model on a limited knowledge base for the diversity of the resources and technical nature of HPC in general has raised questions in optimal knowledge base construction. The following analysis takes a limited test case to investigate the driving factors contributing to the accuracy of the chatbot’s response to predetermined prompts, specifically regarding the clusters on which specific software applications are currently available. It additionally tests the necessity of providing documentation of synonymous terms in the form of a synonym dictionary in the knowledge base. While ongoing, this initial research utilizing logistic regression suggests the knowledge base is yet insufficient for the prompts given and that the synonym dictionary has no statistically significant effect on the response.},

Students are expected to translate programming concepts learned from lectures into executable implementations that solve the tasks outlined in the assignments. These implementations are primarily assessed based on their functional correctness, ensuring that students' code produces the expected output when provided with specific inputs.However, functional correctness is not the only metric that evaluates the quality of programs. Runtime efficiency is a metric that is less frequently evaluated in programming courses, yet it holds significant importance in the context of professional software development. To investigate this gap and its potential ramifications, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the time efficiency of 250 programming assignments that are evaluated solely on functional correctness. The results demonstrate that students' programming assignments exhibit significant variance in terms of execution time. We further identified 27 recurring inefficient code patterns from these assignments, and observed that most of the inefficient patterns can be optimized by automated tools such as PMD, IntelliJ IDEA and ChatGPT. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for educators to enhance the organization and integration of code performance topics throughout the programming course curriculum.},

abstract = {In this tutorial, we will introduce a cybersecurity education framework for developing polymorphic hands-on exercises. Many faculty readily acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity in the Computer Science curriculum, but there are still barriers to integrating it into existing courses. One of those barriers is the fact that in most courses, the current content fills the entire term. Another issues is that faculty don't have time and expertise to create new content that would fit well with their current content and style. The third problem is that exercises created should be resistant to solution by LLMs. We have developed cybersecurity exercises that combine two principles: environment specificity and polymorphism. Environment specificity means that the solutions to the exercise should depend on the local environment (LLMs don't have access to that information). In this context, polymorphism means that they can be easily modified each time that the class is taught.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are changing computing education and may create additional barriers to those already faced by non-native English speakers (NNES) learning computing. We investigate an opportunity for a positive impact of LLMs on NNES through multilingual programming exercise generation. Following previous work with LLM exercise generation in English, we prompt OpenAI GPT-3.5 in 4 natural languages (English, Tamil, Spanish, and Vietnamese) to create introductory programming problems, sample solutions, and test cases. We evaluate these problems on their sensibility, readability, translation, sample solution accuracy, topicality, and cultural relevance. We find that problems generated in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese are largely sensible, easily understood, and accurate in their sample solutions. However, Tamil problems are mostly non-sensible and have a much lower passing test rate, indicating that the abilities of LLMs for problem generation are not generalizable across languages. Our analysis suggests that these problems could not be given verbatim to students, but with minimal effort, most errors can be fixed. We further discuss the benefits of these problems despite their flaws, and their opportunities to provide personalized and culturally relevant resources for students in their native languages.},

abstract = {To recognize the current and future trends and challenges in computer science education educational materials for the next decade, the authors of this work provide a conversation to voice the computer science community's experience and expertise on these trends. One of the biggest challenges for introductory computing courses in the next few years will be leveraging the new capabilities of Artificial Intelligent systems such as Open AI CodeX and GPT3 that can generate code from a textual description, explain code, and translate code between programming languages. These tools could drastically change how introductory programming is taught by allowing students to focus more on understanding code, modifying code, and testing code than on writing code. Learning content is increasingly shifting from paper textbooks to online learning systems, which include not just traditional text and figures, but increasingly use interactive items to provide students with better explanations and illustrations, extensive practice, and frequent immediate formative feedback, typically at a lower cognitive load than classical programming assignment. We will discuss challenges and opportunities for interoperability with publishing and learning management platforms. Another example is how guided-based instruments, such as peer team learning, open educational resources, or workbooks, are adaptive and hybrid according to students' needs.Feedback and point of view from the CS community will be considered as part of the curricular practices "Future of CS educational materials" document, featured in the new version of the CS2023: ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI Computer Science Curricula.},

abstract = {Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized learning in computing education is promising, yet cloud-based LLMs pose risks around data security and privacy. To address these concerns, we developed and deployed a locally stored Small Language Model (SLM) utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. Previous work has demonstrated that SLMs can match or surpass popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) in handling conversational data from a CS1 course. We deployed SLMs with RAG (SLM + RAG) in a large course with more than 250 active students, fielding nearly 2,000 student questions, while evaluating data privacy, scalability, and feasibility of local deployments. This paper provides a comprehensive guide for deploying SLM + RAG systems, detailing model selection, vector database choice, embedding methods, and pipeline frameworks. We share practical insights from our deployment, including scalability concerns, accuracy versus context length trade-offs, guardrails and hallucination reduction, as well as data privacy maintenance. We address the "Impossible Triangle" in RAG systems, which states that achieving high accuracy, short context length, and low time consumption simultaneously is not feasible. Furthermore, our novel RAG framework, Intelligence Concentration (IC), categorizes information into multiple layers of abstraction within Milvus collections mitigating trade-offs and enabling educational assistants to deliver more relevant and personalized responses to students quickly.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for the automatic generation of feedback in a wide range of computing contexts. However, concerns have been voiced around the privacy and ethical implications of sending student work to proprietary models. This has sparked considerable interest in the use of open source LLMs in education, but the quality of the feedback that such open models can produce remains understudied. This is a concern as providing flawed or misleading generated feedback could be detrimental to student learning. Inspired by recent work that has utilised very powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the outputs produced by less powerful models, we conduct an automated analysis of the quality of the feedback produced by several open source models using a dataset from an introductory programming course. First, we investigate the viability of employing GPT-4 as an automated evaluator by comparing its evaluations with those of a human expert. We observe that GPT-4 demonstrates a bias toward positively rating feedback while exhibiting moderate agreement with human raters, showcasing its potential as a feedback evaluator. Second, we explore the quality of feedback generated by several leading open-source LLMs by using GPT-4 to evaluate the feedback. We find that some models offer competitive performance with popular proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, indicating opportunities for their responsible use in educational settings.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial intelligence for teaching and learning in the academic sphere is a trending subject of interest in computing education. ChatGPT, as an AI-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened student involvement, cooperation, accessibility, and availability. This paper addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing ChatGPT as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate Computer Science curriculum in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. Students having completed the course work for a Data Structures and Algorithms (a sophomore-level course) participated in this study. Two groups of students were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. The control group (group A) had access to textbooks and notes of programming courses, however, no Internet access was provided. Group B students were given access to ChatGPT and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using Programming Contest Control (PC2) environment which is widely used in ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of students addresses the problem by writing executable code that satisfies a certain number of test cases. Student teams were scored based on their performance in terms of the number of successfully passed test cases. Results show that students using ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however, there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted code consequently affecting the overall performance. After a thorough analysis, the paper’s findings indicate that incorporating AI in higher education brings about various opportunities and challenges. Nonetheless, universities can efficiently manage these apprehensions by adopting a proactive and ethical stance toward the implementation of such tools.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education.

The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. We plan to share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages—for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with n = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students’ time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

abstract = {Instructional videos are becoming increasingly popular among computer science students. Over 78% of students frequently visit YouTube to find videos as supplement to their textbook or classroom instruction[1]. Recent surveys show that on average, 73% of students prefer having their instructors curate a supplemental video library to aid in their learning. Now, the emergence of generative AI is revolutionizing supplemental video instruction, enabling instructors to generate slides, recording scripts, and produce high-quality videos with deep search and embedded interactive activities.Generative AI also takes the student video learning to a new level by providing AI-generated video summaries, on-demand questions, and exploration of topics in greater depth. Integrating AI into standard videos greatly expands the possibilities of video-based learning. This workshop demonstrates how educators can enhance their existing video playlists by incorporating AI to increase student engagement and establish safety measures for AI use in education. By using dynamic dashboards, scheduled content, and gamified questions, instructors can maintain student focus.Drawing on insights from computer science courses taught at Princeton and Rutgers Universities, we will highlight the transformative potential of AI-enhanced videos in promoting active learning, particularly in large classes. We will discuss engagement strategies and real-time data visualizations applicable to any video platform. We will utilize the cubits.ai[2] platform, a Princeton University initiative that enhances the impact of computer science courses. The platform is free, and participants are encouraged to bring their own video playlists to curate them into AI-enabled collections by enhancing the student experience through integrated generative AI.},

abstract = {Programming has been considered the "essence of informatics" since the beginning of computing as a discipline. But programming in the fifties was very different from what we know today, and one of the goals (or dreams) throughout the history of programming language technology, has been "automatic programming''---the ability to automatically generate computer code starting from a high(er)-level description of the specification of that code. What this meant changed over the years, from punching paper tape, to compiling high-level programming languages, to program synthesis.Today, however, the availability of machine learning artefacts that produce high-level code from natural language specifications has completely changed the traditional meaning. To the extent that some computer scientists have begun to question the received wisdom that the core of their discipline is deeply rooted in programming.If programming and programming languages are no longer the essence of computer science, this changes the epistemology of the discipline itself. Moreover, if we are at the end of programming, we should also change the curriculum, where programming, algorithms and programming languages play a major role. Several recent papers reviewed the performance of code generators based on large language models on typical CS1 problems (e.g., from the many possible citations and how machine learning impacts K-12 teaching.Starting from this data, I will argue for the role of programming in the curriculum, distinguishing between programming taught as part of a holistic curriculum (as in some non-technical high schools) or as a vocational tool. I will use Simondon's notion of (closed and open) technical object as an interpretive lens, together with Calvino's reflections on the availability of writing machines capable of replacing the poet and the author.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) present an exciting opportunity for generating synthetic classroom data. Such data could include code containing a typical distribution of errors, simulated student behavior to address the cold start problem when developing education tools, and synthetic user data when access to authentic data is restricted due to privacy reasons. In this research paper, we conduct a comparative study examining the distribution of bugs generated by LLMs in contrast to those produced by computing students. Leveraging data from two previous large-scale analyses of student-generated bugs, we investigate whether LLMs can be coaxed to exhibit bug patterns that are similar to authentic student bugs when prompted to inject errors into code. The results suggest that unguided, LLMs do not generate plausible error distributions, and many of the generated errors are unlikely to be generated by real students. However, with guidance including descriptions of common errors and typical frequencies, LLMs can be shepherded to generate realistic distributions of errors in synthetic code.},

abstract = {Generative AI tools are rapidly evolving and impacting many domains, including programming. Computer Science (CS) instructors must address student access to these tools. While some advocate to ban the tools entirely, others suggest embracing them so that students develop the skills for utilizing the tools safely and responsibly. Studies indicate positive impacts, as well as cautions, on student outcomes when these tools are integrated into courses. We studied the impact of incorporating instruction on industry-standard generative AI tools into a mid-level software development course with students from 16 Minority Serving Institutions. 89% of student participants used generative AI tools prior to the course without any formal instruction. After formal instruction, students most frequently used generative AI tools for explaining concepts and learning new things. Students generally reported positive viewpoints on their ability to learn to program and learn problem-solving skills while using generative AI tools. Finally, we found that students: reported to understand their code when they work with generative AI tools, are critical about the outputs that generative AI tools provide, and check outputs of generative AI tools to ensure accuracy.},

abstract = {Large language models are reshaping computing education. Based on recent research, these models explain code better than students, answer multiple choice questions at or above the class average, and generate code that can pass automated tests in introductory courses. In response to these capabilities, instructors have quickly adjusted their courses and assessment methods to align with shifting learning goals and the increased risk of academic integrity issues. While some scholars have advocated for the integration of visual problems as a safeguard against the capabilities of language models, new multimodal models now have vision and language capabilities that may allow them to analyze and solve visual problems. In this paper, we compare the large multimodal model (LMMs) GPT-4V with Bard, an LLM that uses Google Lens for text recognition. We find that LMMs, which have learned both pixel features (from images) and text features (from prompts) in the same embedding space, performed substantially better than Bard which uses a piecemeal approach. With a specific focus on Parsons problems presented across diverse visual representations, our results show that GPT-4V solved 96.7% these visual problems, struggling minimally with a single Parsons problem. Conversely, Bard performed poorly by only solving 69.2% of problems, struggling with common issues like hallucinations and refusals. These findings suggest that merely transitioning to visual programming problems might not be a panacea to issues of academic integrity in the generative AI era.},

Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER, however, has focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments and judging the quality of programming feedback, contrasting the results with proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to introductory Python programming exercises suggest that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs are nearly on par with proprietary models in both generating and assessing programming feedback. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in these tasks and highlight the wide range of LLMs accessible, even for free, to educators and practitioners.},

Computing education researchers have found that LLMs can solve most assessments in introductory programming courses, including both traditional code writing tasks and other popular tasks such as Parsons problems. As more and more students start to make use of LLMs, the question instructors might ask themselves is "what can I do?". We propose that one promising way forward is to integrate LLMs into teaching practice, providing all students with an equal opportunity to learn how to interact productively with LLMs as well as encounter and understand their limitations. In this workshop, we first present state-of-the-art research results on how to utilize LLMs in computing education practice, after which participants will take part in hands-on activities using LLMs. We end the workshop by brainstorming ideas with participants around adapting their classrooms to most effectively integrate LLMs while avoiding some common pitfalls.},

abstract = {Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system.To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s).We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically generative AI (GenAI) are threatening to fundamentally reshape computing and society. Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving.There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms.},

Recent developments, such as ChatGPT, have further pushed the significance of AI, garnering media attention and prompting politicians to require stakeholders in education to place a stronger emphasis on AI education in schools. As a result, a growing number of computer science (CS) curricula are expanding to include the topic of AI. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of AI in K-10 education in Germany by analyzing CS curricula for lower secondary school education across the 16 federal states of Germany. The results indicate that AI-related content is inconsistently addressed in the CS curricula of various federal states, with a noticeable absence of standardized AI competencies for K-10 education. In several federal states, AI-related content is only implicitly addressed from a socio-cultural perspective. To ensure up-to-date education, it is essential to include mandatory AI content in K-10 CS curricula. These contents should be considered holistically by taking into account the technological, socio-cultural, and user-oriented perspectives, in accordance with the Dagstuhl Triangle.},

abstract = {To broaden participation, competitive programming contests may include beginner-level problems that do not require knowledge of advanced Computer Science concepts (e.g., algorithms and data structures). However, since most participants have easy access to AI code-generation tools, these problems often become trivial to solve. For beginner-friendly programming contests that do not prohibit the use of AI tools, we propose Probeable Problems: code writing tasks that provide (1)&nbsp;a problem specification that deliberately omits certain details, and (2)&nbsp;a mechanism to probe for these details by asking clarifying questions and receiving immediate feedback. To evaluate our proposal, we conducted a 2-hour programming contest for undergraduate Computer Science students from multiple institutions, where each student was an active member of their institution’s ACM student chapter. The contest comprised of six Probeable Problems for which a popular code-generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) were unable to generate accurate solutions due to the absence of details. Students were permitted to work individually or in groups, and were free to use AI tools. We obtained consent from 26&nbsp;groups (67&nbsp;students) to use their submissions for research. To determine whether Probeable Problems are suitable for such contests, we analyze the extent to which the code submitted by these groups identifies missing details.},

abstract = {The task of decomposing a problem into sub-problems to build a solution, also formalized as planning in prior work, is a key skill for programming expertise. Improving the decomposition and planning skills of novices is shown to be a challenging goal for educators. Moreover, decomposing complex projects into smaller subtasks is an increasingly relevant skill with rapid developments in tools like large language models (LLMs). While there are many aspects of planning, one skill consistently observed in studies with experts is the ability to identify subtasks that can be solved via common code patterns. To support students in acquiring these skills, many researchers have explored explicit instruction about a set of common patterns in programs (i.e. programming plans). However, recent work implies that students may need additional support to fully benefit from such interventions. This panel aims to bring computing education researchers together to discuss the main challenges around teaching decomposition and planning using common patterns, the crucial factors for designing instruction for teaching these concepts, and the impact evolving technology like LLMs can have on these developments.},

It is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education, and serves over 10 million active users. Colab is used extensively for teaching computer science and machine learning, giving equitable access to expensive resources and AI/ML instruction to students around the world, regardless of background. As one professor stated: ''There's an equity aspect. Not everyone has a high-end laptop. Being able to say everyone has the same computing experience and they all have access to the same resources and they can start using them right away, it allows us to find more talent randomly distributed around our student population. Colab has been the best solution so far.'' Additionally, Google Colab partners with Google DeepMind to launch innovative AI coding features and models to the public, giving users the ability to author code with natural language, a much simpler experience for writing code. We are the team who builds Colab, and would love to demo our latest features, including Google Classroom integration and AI coding using Gemini, Google's latest foundation AI model. We hope to make attendees aware of these features and have them give us feedback on their usefulness and impact on the process of teaching computer science and machine learning.},

In fact, a study in 2022 had ranked Codex in the top quartile w.r.t students in a large Python programming course&nbsp;[8]. However, all these works consider only text-based Python programming and leave open the question of how well these models would perform for visual programming. The main research question is: Do state-of-the-art neural generative models show advanced capabilities for visual programming on par with their capabilities on text-based Python programming?In our work, we evaluate these models for visual programming based on the following three settings designed to capture various generative and problem-solving capabilities: We conduct our evaluation based on 10 representative tasks from two visual programming domains: Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5] and Intro to Programming with Karel course by CodeHS.com&nbsp;[3, 13]. As illustrative examples, Figures&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 show the output of GPT-4 in three settings for Maze18 task. We will provide the detailed analysis and prompts used in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results for ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 show that these models perform poorly and produce incorrect output the majority of the time. These results highlight that state-of-the-art neural generative models like GPT-4 still struggle to combine spatial, logical, and programming skills crucial for visual programming. As the next step, it would be important to curate novel benchmarks that the research community can use to evaluate improvements in future versions of these models for visual programming.},

abstract = {In the era of AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, and with the numerous online resources, computer science education faces the challenge of students potentially submitting plagiarised coding assignments or assignments generated by these technologies. Distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written text is notoriously difficult. In this study, we applied two text distance algorithms, commonly used for machine translation and document comparisons, to detect similarities between various computer Python code submissions and employed hierarchical clustering to analyze them from both AI tools and human programmers. Our results indicate that the distances to the cluster representatives can effectively predict whether a code submission is generated by AI or by novice programmers, achieving an accuracy of over 90%. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of text distance algorithms in identifying the origin of coding submissions, whether generated by AI or by novice programmers.},

To help with this, a good analogy can bridge the gap between unfamiliar concepts and familiar ones, providing an engaging way to aid understanding. However, creating effective educational analogies is difficult even for experienced instructors. We investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, can provide access to personally relevant analogies on demand. Focusing on recursion, a challenging threshold concept, we conducted an investigation analyzing the analogies generated by more than 350 first-year computing students. They were provided with a code snippet and tasked to generate their own recursion-based analogies using ChatGPT, optionally including personally relevant topics in their prompts. We observed a great deal of diversity in the analogies produced with student-prescribed topics, in contrast to the otherwise generic analogies, highlighting the value of student creativity when working with LLMs. Not only did students enjoy the activity and report an improved understanding of recursion, but they described more easily remembering analogies that were personally and culturally relevant.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous use of online tools, contractors and homework sites, has made plagiarism a concerning topic in computer science education. With the introduction of ChatGPT, it poses a threat now more than ever. Many cheating detection tools, such as similarity checkers and style anomaly checkers, help instructors decide whether a student has plagiarized. However, these are not scalable to large classes. Similarity tools can produce high rates of suspected cheating and thus ineffectively use an instructor's time in weeding out the actual cheating cases, especially in the early weeks of CS courses where programs can be small and student solutions can be very similar. We developed a new approach using outlier detection to filter inconsistent performers based on their lab scores throughout the course and their midterm exam scores. Instructors can then manually analyze a manageable amount of students even with large class sizes. We performed our experiment on two large course offerings of CS1 (a total of 177 students) using our algorithm and compared it to a manual analysis performed by an experienced CS1 instructor. The detection approach identified 11 students in the first offering (Winter 2019) and 12 students in the second offering (Spring 2023). With an average precision of 83%, our tool produces a list of concerning students with high precision. This significantly helps teachers efficiently allocate their time and pursue cheating early in the term in order to address and prevent further issues.},

That theory, with its hierarchy of formal grammars, has laid the foundation for the theory and practice of language compilers. The principal tenet of Chomsky's theory is that grammar precedes language.},

abstract = {As AI tools like ChatGPT become more prevalent in educational settings, their potential to assist undergraduate teaching assistants (uTAs) in large Computer Science 2 (CS2) courses presents both opportunities and challenges. This work focuses on how ChatGPT can be strategically utilized by uTAs during office hours to enhance student support, particularly in complex topics such as data structures, algorithm development, and object-oriented programming. We explored effective strategies for uTAs to use ChatGPT in ways that promote deeper student understanding without compromising the development of independent problem-solving skills. Key strategies include leveraging ChatGPT for real-time code debugging assistance, offering alternative approaches to solving coding problems, comparing and critiquing self and AI generated documentation, and code reviewing. This work also identifies potential challenges, such as the risk of students or uTAs becoming overly dependent on AI-generated solutions and the possibility of inaccurate or incomplete responses from the AI. Hence, our findings highlight the dual role of ChatGPT as both an asset and a potential hindrance, depending on how it is utilized. To mitigate these risks, we propose a set of best practices that ensure ChatGPT enhances, rather than replaces, the uTA's role as a facilitator of learning. The findings from this research provide valuable insights into how uTAs can integrate AI tools thoughtfully into office hours to offer more effective support, ultimately improving student engagement and learning outcomes in large-scale CS2 courses.},

These Questions about Learners' Code (QLCs) are created through program analysis, exploring execution paths, and then creating code comprehension questions from these paths and the broader code structure. Responding to the questions requires reading and tracing the code, which is known to support students' learning. At the same time, computing education researchers have witnessed the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have taken the community by storm. Researchers have demonstrated the applicability of these models especially in the introductory programming context, outlining their performance in solving introductory programming problems and their utility in creating new learning resources. In this work, we explore the capability of the state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in answering QLCs that are generated from code that the LLMs have created. Our results show that although the state-of-the-art LLMs can create programs and trace program execution when prompted, they easily succumb to similar errors that have previously been recorded for novice programmers. These results demonstrate the fallibility of these models and perhaps dampen the expectations fueled by the recent LLM hype. At the same time, we also highlight future research possibilities such as using LLMs to mimic students as their behavior can indeed be similar for some specific tasks.},

abstract = {With the mainstream adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), members of both academia and the media have raised concerns around their impact on student learning and pedagogy. Many students and educators wonder about the pedagogical fit of this emerging technology. We aim to measure the adoption of and attitudes toward LLMs among the CS student population at an R1 University to determine how students are using these new tools. To this end, we conducted a large survey study targeting two populations participating in computing courses at the university: intro-sequence students (ISS) and experienced students (ES).In our preliminary results from Spring 2023, we've found several significant differences among the views of over 700 respondents across the two groups. Most students reported LLMs' unparalleled potential for quick information access, yet many harbor concerns about the reliability of the LLM responses, and the impact on academic integrity. Additionally, while ES have rapidly integrated LLMs into their learning, ISS remain cautious of the tools, highlighting a stark contrast in adoption rates between the groups.LLMs are clearly going to reshape pedagogical approaches and student engagement. Our study hopes to provide insight on the nuanced student attitudes toward LLMs. For example, the notable reservations expressed by ISS illustrate an imperative for careful, informed, and ethical integration to ensure these tools enhance rather than compromise the educational experience. In the future, we plan to continue tracking student attitudes in order to gain further understanding of the changing perceptions of LLMs and their impact.},

abstract = {Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior – in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students (n = 964) solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming.},

These tools have demonstrated considerable ability to generate code and answer conceptual questions, rendering them incredibly useful for completing CS coursework. While overreliance on AI tools could hinder students’ learning, we believe they have the potential to be a helpful resource for both students and instructors alike. We propose a novel system for instructor-mediated GPT interaction in a class discussion board. By automatically generating draft responses to student forum posts, GPT can help Teaching Assistants (TAs) respond to student questions in a more timely manner, giving students an avenue to receive fast, quality feedback on their solutions without turning to ChatGPT directly. Additionally, since they are involved in the process, instructors can ensure that the information students receive is accurate, and can provide students with incremental hints that encourage them to engage critically with the material, rather than just copying an AI-generated snippet of code. We utilize Piazza—a popular educational forum where TAs help students via text exchanges—as a venue for GPT-assisted TA responses to student questions. These student questions are sent to GPT-4 alongside assignment instructions and a customizable prompt, both of which are stored in editable instructor-only Piazza posts. We demonstrate an initial implementation of this system, and provide examples of student questions that highlight its benefits.},

abstract = {Having spent the past year post-retirement working with my alma mater, New Mexico State University's (NMSU) Computer Science department to broaden computing, increase student engagement, and to improve graduation completion, as well as reflecting on the state of computing in society at large, I thought I'd share some observations. In March of this year, I had the opportunity to participate in the SIGCSE 2022 Technical Symposium. I was struck by Dr. Shaundra Daily's plenary keynote, entitled "Diversifying Computing: Real Change Must Come from Within", and her use of the phrase "navigating systems that were not designed for me" as she described her exploration of STEM as a first-generation college student, as both a dance and an engineering student, and as a graduate student preparing for motherhood lacking flexibility during her pregnancy, no maternity leave, no livable stipend, and a lack of affordable childcare, as well as the coping strategies she needed to develop to deal with academic culture. In my work with NMSU this past spring, co-teaching a problem solving course, my work this fall advising CS students, and my board roles serving on the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Roundtable for Systemic Change in Undergraduate STEM Education co-chairing the "Culture of STEM" workgroup, on the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institution's (CAHSI) Advisory Board, and on the Computing Research Association for Widening Participation (CRA-WP), co-editing the "Expanding the Pipeline" column, it's clear that system design adversely impacts society in terms of determining not only who gets to participate in the design of computer hardware and software, but also who gets to advance in social and economic mobility. Academic institutions are complex systems in need of an overhaul, by the University of California's academic workers strike for better pay and benefits. The design and commercialization of AI without fully understanding the implications of bias and ethics is inherently a system design problem. The application to everything from AI generated art and images (and how to spot deep fakes), the ability of large language models (LLMs) to create volumes of text generated articles that appear legitimate with the capacity to spread hate and misinformation globally are but just a few examples of the potentially horrific impact to society, because humans cannot work at the pace and scale to validate and/or authenticate them, with few if any meaningful domestic and international laws or policies in place to safeguard us.},

We present an example of an assessment which allows learners to use GenAI in a freeform, constructionist manner, as part of a large, software development project. This work is inspired by previously executed AI-focused assessments and surveys, which explicitly indicate that learners on an Applied Software Engineering Degree Apprenticeship Programme want to formally learn how to use GenAI tools when programming and their employers want to see these skills from graduates. The learning outcome of the assignment was for learners to explore a typical developmental pipeline as a solo developer, moving from design to development to finished product. Learners were marked exclusively on their end product and understanding of application components, not the written code itself, resulting in an assessment where the end product and project were prioritised over foundational code (which was adequately assessed in other components). The results show that all learners used GenAI to some extent during their project, and in all cases, they found it beneficial for large programming tasks. Learners were generally able to produce a larger, more comprehensive and more ambitious project, compared to previous years. It is proposed that removing the barrier to GenAI - and demystifying it - can encourage a constructionist approach to its use, and normalise it as a potential tool for programming.},

Matching of NodeGrade’s output with multiple human expert raters reveals some weaknesses regarding cases at the lower and upper boundary. In terms of user experience, the interviewed and observed students recognized both positive facets, like better learning support and helpful feedback, and negative sides, including technical limitations and lack of transparency. Overall, NodeGrade promises high potential for further practical use and testing in the field of software engineering education and automatic short answer grading.},

abstract = {Three student personas were created, each representing a way in which current students interact with AI tools such as ChatGPT when completing introductory computer science assignments. Four undergraduate students assumed the role of each of the personas in turn and two semesters worth of current assignments were completed in each persona. The results and experiences were then analyzed to determine aspects of the assignments that made it more (or less) difficult to complete them using the AI tools, with an eye towards whether small changes in phrasing or requirements might result in significant changes in this metric.Three of the main takeaways were that LLMs are more difficult for students to use when assignments 1) consist of many small steps, 2) make use of external code libraries, or 3) involve spatial reasoning.Finally, the student/persona experiences helped to generate a list of opportunities for instructors to proactively include the use of AI tools in current assignments without sacrificing any of the current learning objectives.The initial phase involved labs from one institution and used only one AI tool, but follow-up work involving the use of other tools and labs from other institutions validated those core conclusions. A student survey (as well as other published literature) also validated the choice of personas.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {As robots become increasingly integrated into human life, personalizing human-robot interactions (HRI) is crucial for improving user acceptance, engagement, and interaction quality. However, personalizing HRI poses a unique challenge due to the diversity of human personality traits. This paper proposes a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically tailor robot conversations according to the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits. Our novelty lies in using user personality traits to shape robots' verbal responses and implementing contextual action generation for gestures. This study addresses two primary research questions: (1) Does adapting robots' verbal responses based on user personality traits improve communication satisfaction? (2) How does the addition of context-appropriate gestures further enhance user satisfaction? We used Goldberg's personality trait measurement scale (1992) to assess 26 participants who engaged in conversations with an LLM-powered Pepper robot on various topics. The quality of these interactions was self-reported using a revised version of Hecht's (1978) conversation satisfaction scale. Three experimental conditions were conducted: (i) Baseline: Standard LLM conversation, (ii) Personality-congruent: LLM-adjusted dialogue based on personality of participants, and (iii) Enhanced interaction: Personality adaptation plus dynamic gestures. For the third condition, we implemented contextually appropriate pre-defined animations and generated novel gestures by computing joint angle values in real time. Statistical analysis using ANOVA revealed significant differences in communication satisfaction across the three conditions (F=13.41, p&lt;.001). Post-hoc analyses using \v{S}id\'{a}k's multiple comparison test showed significant pairwise differences: Condition 2 vs. 1: Δ Δmean 4.42 , p = 0.02; Condition 3 vs. 1: Δ Δmean 8.23, p &lt; 0.01; Condition 3 vs. 2: Δ Δmean 3.80, p = 0.05. These results demonstrate that both personality-congruent interactions and non-verbal gestures significantly enhance communication satisfaction, with the combined approach yielding the highest satisfaction. This approach opens new possibilities for developing socially intelligent robots with applications in healthcare, education, and customer service.},

We assess existing error message enhancement strategies, as well as two novel approaches of our own: (1) generating error messages using OpenAI's GPT in real time and (2) constructing error messages that incorporate the course discussion forum. By examining students' direct responses to error messages, and their behavior throughout the course, we quantitatively evaluate the immediate and longer term efficacy of different error message types. We find that students using GPT generated error messages repeat an error 23.1% less often in the subsequent attempt, and resolve an error in 34.8% fewer additional attempts, compared to students using standard error messages. We also perform an analysis across various demographics to understand any disparities in the impact of different error message types. Our results find no significant difference in the effectiveness of GPT generated error messages for students from varying socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Our findings underscore GPT generated error messages as the most helpful error message type, especially as a universally effective intervention across demographics.},

abstract = {Background. Concurrent and parallel programming is difficult to teach and learn as the understanding of complex and abstract concepts such as nondeterminism, semaphore, and rare conditions, among others, is required [1, 2, 9], having as a core issue the synchronisation of processes to achieve a common goal [4]. It is well-acknowledged that concurrent and parallel programming skills are fundamental since, nowadays, computing is increasingly handled in a parallel manner [7].Problem and Motivation. Therefore, identifying students’ pitfalls and successes when solving practical concurrent and parallel programming exercises could shed light on the best approaches and strategies that they use [3]. In addition, the advent of large language models, and generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, has prompted intensive research on their use in several areas including programming teaching and learning [8]. Yet, the studies in the literature have focused on issues related to learning to program by novice students in introductory courses (e.g., CS1, CS2) [6]. Less work, however, has been presented on the impact of generative AI tools in advanced programming practices such as concurrent and parallel programming.Methodology. To investigate whether generative AI has had an impact on the submitted concurrent and parallel programming exercises solutions at the University of Aizu, Japan, we performed a comparison analysis of the students’ submissions over 2020–2023. The analysis included five different exercises covering the basis of concurrency through various tasks and scenarios where the implementation of parallel processes is needed as solution. For instance, exercises 2.3 and 2.4 required to create parallel processes and perform independent computations; exercises 3.2 and 3.3, required synchronisation of the parallel processes; and in exercise 3.5 a code template was given for modification. We analysed the submissions of 72 undergraduate 3rd year students (avg. 18 students/year) and labelled the solutions using the following nomenclature: OK, indicating a good solution; OKFeat, a good solution but with unusual features; AdvLib, use of unnecessary advanced library or functionality; BadTool, use of an inappropriate tool when the task definition explicitly required a different tool; CodeErr, general coding error; SyncErr, concurrent programming specific error; N/A, solution not submitted or incomplete.Results and Analysis. Results show a substantial increase in the incidence of use of advance libraries (AdvLib) and the wrong tools (BadTool) among students in 2023 for three out of the five analysed exercises. At the same time the concurrency programming-specific errors (SyncErr) also see a reduction in all the exercises. (Figure 1). This coincides with the availability of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT [5], which warrants further investigations to understand how students, teachers and instructors could harness the affordances of large language models in their concurrent programming learning, teaching, and practice.Contribution and Impact. This paper presents an initial step towards investigating the impact of generative AI on advanced programming topics. This research will continue to uncover strategies for the lecturers and instructors to identify the affordances and use of generative AI and to design exercises that harness these affordances to support students learning of difficult programming concepts.},

abstract = {Reasoning about code and explaining its purpose are fundamental skills for computer scientists. There has been extensive research in the field of computing education on the relationship between a student's ability to explain code and other skills such as writing and tracing code. In particular, the ability to describe at a high-level of abstraction how code will behave over all possible inputs correlates strongly with code writing skills. However, developing the expertise to comprehend and explain code accurately and succinctly is a challenge for many students. Existing pedagogical approaches that scaffold the ability to explain code, such as producing exemplar code explanations on demand, do not currently scale well to large classrooms. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) may offer a solution. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in generating explanations that can serve as examples to scaffold students' ability to understand and explain code. To evaluate LLM-created explanations, we compare them with explanations created by students in a large course (n ≈ 1000) with respect to accuracy, understandability and length. We find that LLM-created explanations, which can be produced automatically on demand, are rated as being significantly easier to understand and more accurate summaries of code than student-created explanations. We discuss the significance of this finding, and suggest how such models can be incorporated into introductory programming education.},

abstract = {Worked examples, which illustrate the process for solving a problem step-by-step, are a well-established pedagogical technique that has been widely studied in computing classrooms. However, creating high-quality worked examples is very time-intensive for educators, and thus learners tend not to have access to a broad range of such examples. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), which appear capable of generating high-quality human-like content, may offer a solution. Separate strands of recent work have shown that LLMs can accurately generate code suitable for a novice audience, and that they can generate high-quality explanations of code. Therefore, LLMs may be well suited to creating a broad range of worked examples, overcoming the bottleneck of manual effort that is currently required. In this work, we present a novel tool, ‘WorkedGen’, which uses an LLM to generate interactive worked examples. We evaluate this tool with both an expert assessment of the content, and a user study involving students in a first-year Python programming course (n = ~400). We find that prompt chaining and one-shot learning are useful strategies for optimising the output of an LLM when producing worked examples. Our expert analysis suggests that LLMs generate clear explanations, and our classroom deployment revealed that students find the LLM-generated worked examples useful for their learning. We propose several avenues for future work, including investigating WorkedGen’s value in a range of programming languages, and with more complex questions suitable for more advanced courses.},

abstract = {This poster explores the potential of ChatGPT to replace the traditional approach of pair programming in introductory computer science courses. Traditionally, two students collaborate as a driver and a navigator, periodically switching roles. Now, a student can pair up with ChatGPT, which offers an innovative approach to pair programming. This exploratory activity, which emphasizes collaboration and communication, provides step-by-step instructions for effectively interacting with ChatGPT during pair programming.This poster reflects on the advantages and limitations of using ChatGPT in pair programming. The main advantages of using ChatGPT include rapid responses, syntax error-free code generation, and flexibility in handling incomplete pseudocode. The primary limitations include the coding generation style, redundancy in responses, and challenges in understanding the code. Despite the advantages, it may still be valuable to have students work with human partners in certain situations, particularly for learning purposes.This poster proposes that ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for enhancing productivity and emphasizes the importance of becoming proficient in its use during students' college years. It also provides insights into the effective utilization of ChatGPT in pair programming and its preparation for future careers in programming and related fields.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of code generation tools powered by large language models has attracted wide attention. Models such as OpenAI Codex can take natural language problem descriptions as input and generate highly accurate source code solutions, with potentially significant implications for computing education. Given the many complexities that students face when learning to write code, they may quickly become reliant on such tools without properly understanding the underlying concepts. One popular approach for scaffolding the code writing process is to use Parsons problems, which present solution lines of code in a scrambled order. These remove the complexities of low-level syntax, and allow students to focus on algorithmic and design-level problem solving. It is unclear how well code generation models can be applied to solve Parsons problems, given the mechanics of these models and prior evidence that they underperform when problems include specific restrictions. In this paper, we explore the performance of the Codex model for solving Parsons problems over various prompt variations. Using a corpus of Parsons problems we sourced from the computing education literature, we find that Codex successfully reorders the problem blocks about half of the time, a much lower rate of success when compared to prior work on more free-form programming tasks. Regarding prompts, we find that small variations in prompting have a noticeable effect on model performance, although the effect is not as pronounced as between different problems.},

abstract = {In late 2022, OpenAI released a new version of ChatGPT, a sophisticated natural language processing system capable of holding natural conversations while preserving and responding to the context of the discussion. ChatGPT has exceeded expectations in its abilities, leading to extensive considerations of its potential applications and misuse. In this work, we evaluate the influence of ChatGPT on university education, with a primary focus on computer security-oriented specialization. We gather data regarding the effectiveness and usability of this tool for completing exams, programming assignments, and term papers. We evaluate multiple levels of tool misuse, ranging from utilizing it as a consultant to simply copying its outputs. While we demonstrate how easily ChatGPT can be used to cheat, we also discuss the potentially significant benefits to the educational system. For instance, it might be used as an aid (assistant) to discuss problems encountered while solving an assignment or to speed up the learning process. Ultimately, we discuss how computer science higher education should adapt to tools like ChatGPT.},

In this paper, we report on our experiences generating multiple code explanation types using LLMs and integrating them into an interactive e-book on web software development. Three different types of explanations -- a line-by-line explanation, a list of important concepts, and a high-level summary of the code -- were created. Students could view explanations by clicking a button next to code snippets, which showed the explanation and asked about its utility. Our results show that all explanation types were viewed by students and that the majority of students perceived the code explanations as helpful to them. However, student engagement varied by code snippet complexity, explanation type, and code snippet length. Drawing on our experiences, we discuss future directions for integrating explanations generated by LLMs into CS classrooms.},

Moreover, developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education, are gaining prominence, yet we do not understand its value or how best to implement it in post-primary educational settings. Despite a growing international body of research in this area, my scoping review highlights that many aspects of these topics have yet to be explored, particularly in the context of post-primary students in Ireland. My study will begin to bridge this gap by exploring how a purposeful sample of LCCS post-primary students in Ireland engage with GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, during their initial experiences learning Python programming. These findings, when approached through the lens of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI), can help enhance pedagogical strategies and lead to improved learning experiences for students.},

Similarly, our industrial partners have a clear interest for their employees to be formally prepared to use GenAI in their software engineering roles. In this vein, it is proposed that embedding the use of GenAI tools in a careful and creative way - by developing assessments which encourage learners to critically evaluate AI output - can be beneficial in helping learners understand the subject material being taught without the risk of the AI tools “doing the homework”.},

abstract = {Students in introductory computing courses often lack the experience required to effectively identify and resolve errors in their code. For such students, Programming Error Messages (PEMs) are often the first indication of an error, and could provide valuable debugging guidance. However, in many cases, such as with standard C compiler implementations, PEMs are largely unsuitable for novices. Confusing, misleading, and filled with terse language and jargon, these messages instead act as an additional source of difficulty.In this paper, we present DCC Sidekick, which integrates the Debugging C Compiler (DCC) with a Large Language Model (LLM) in a web-based dashboard to produce contextual, accurate guidance conducive to student learning. This dashboard is directly accessible from the output of the compiler, and provides a bird's-eye-view of the program source, compiler output, and a conversational AI interface to help unravel cryptic error messages. We aim to deploy DCC Sidekick to a C-based CS1 cohort at a large higher education institution to investigate how novice students utilise the conversational explanation interface during debugging activities. In this work, we present our experience designing and building DCC Sidekick.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-driven Development Environments (AIDEs) offer developers revolutionary computer programming assistance. There is great potential in incorporating AIDEs into Computer Science education; however, the effects of these tools should be fully examined before doing so. Here, a within-subjects study was conducted to compare the programming performance, workload, emotion, and self-efficacy of seventeen novices coding with and without use of the GitHub Copilot AIDE under time pressure. Results showed that using the AIDE significantly increased programming efficiency and reduced effort and mental workload but did not significantly impact emotion or self-efficacy. However, participants' performance improved with more experience using the AI, and their self-efficacy followed. The results suggest that students who try AIDEs will likely be tempted to use them for time-sensitive work. There is no evidence that providing AIDEs will aid struggling students, but there is a clear need for students to practice with AI to become competent and confident using it.},

abstract = {Edugator is a browser-based, AI-enabled tool designed to help instructors of introductory computing courses create and deliver interactive educational content. It streamlines the content authoring process by incorporating generative AI models into both the creation and delivery stages. Instructors can create bespoke interactive computing lessons and programming problems by providing a prompt and a few clicks. They can also author templates and test cases in programming languages such as C++, Java, C, and Python. Additionally, instructors can validate programming problems by running them against an auto-generated solution, allowing them to refine the problems before releasing it to students, preventing misinformation or ambiguity. Students can complete lessons and solve programming problems in a browser-based text editor receiving immediate feedback. They can also interact with a large language model-powered AI chatbot that scaffolds a student on how to approach the problem without giving out solutions. Edugator is built using modern web frameworks and the goal of the tool is to accelerate the adoption of automated assessment tools by minimizing the challenges instructors face with such tools. It also supports Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), allowing seamless integration with learning management systems (LMS). The demo will provide an overview of Edugator's features, including authoring programming problems and lessons using AI or remixing existing problems obtained from test banks, LTI integration, and AI-chatbot.

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

abstract = {Computational thinking and computer science are now being introduced in K-5 classrooms and this has led to a demand for more engaging and interactive tools designed for a younger audience. Educational games and block-based programming are two approaches that have been shown to be effective at engaging children to learn computer science. While existing tools have value, they also have limitations with respect to their support for collaborative learning and with respect to equitable access. Run, Llama, Run, is a collaborative educational game designed to be played by K-5 students both with and without access to a tablet or computer. The game includes physical programming blocks where a group of students work together to find a solution for a given scenario. A digital interface is available to execute and animate student solutions and a non-digital alternative allows students to act out their solutions. This demo of Run, Llama, Run provides a chance for participants to play both versions of the game and observe the potential impact this game could have for students.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

abstract = {In response to the recent surge in easily accessible generative AI, Harvey Mudd College has integrated AI-assisted coding into the introductory Computer Science course. In this context, a question arises: How do we measure the quality of students' code when AI-generated code is present?Allowing generative AI to write coding assignments comes with the expectation of improved efficiency and accuracy. While generative AI is a useful tool, it merely supplements fundamental computing skills. This technological step towards being fully syntax-free allows for emphasis on the already important skill of developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills in more abstract contexts. In past years, metrics were designed to measure quantitative aspects of code, but these metrics alone are insufficient when evaluating how code written with the assistance of AI will perform in broader applications. When students submit code written with the assistance of generative AI, they are still expected to meet standards given by past metrics, such as Correctness and Complexity. To establish foundational computing skills, students will also be held to new standards and evaluated by new metrics such as Individuality and Ambition.While the model does give objective measures of the metrics, due to the fast-evolving nature of programming, predefined rules-of-thumb for these metrics are not provided. As users of our system, we recognize that evaluating the measurements will require our judgment, which will evolve over time. This work offers the foundation for that evolution.},

In pursuit of this goal, we have developed KOGI, a learning support system that integrates ChatGPT into the Jupyter environment. This paper demonstrates how KOGI enables students to receive timely advice from ChatGPT in response to errors and other questions they encounter.  

We immediately introduced KOGI in our two introductory courses: Algorithms and Data Science. The introduction of KOGI resulted in a significant decrease in the number of unresolved student errors. In addition, we report on student trends observed in the classroom regarding the type and frequency of help requested. Although our findings are preliminary, they are informative for programming instructors interested in using ChatGPT.},

abstract = {Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, has garnered attention in computer science education. This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey.With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.},

abstract = {In an effort to foster critical reflection on the usage of generative AI (genAI) during computer science writing assignments, this three-part assignment challenges students to predict whether their peers can detect which essays are generated using AI. Implemented as part of a third-year professional responsibility and technical writing course for N=200 students during Spring 2024, students individually generated two short persuasive essays, one using genAI and the other without. They then combined the two essays into a single document and submitted it for peer-review. Additionally, they formulated a guess on whether their peers would be able to detect which essay was generated as well as a rationale for their guess. Following the peer-review process, students reflected on their own experience trying to detect which essays were generated as well as the outcome of their guess about their peers abilities as well. Feedback indicates its effectiveness in engaging students in their understanding of the potentials and limitations of genAI. Recommended prerequisites include a clear course AI-usage policy and a brief overview of genAI prompt engineering.},

However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.},

abstract = {Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) has become pervasive in all aspects of computing, so it is essential that students include parallelism and distribution in the computational thinking that they apply to problem solving, from the beginning of their computing education. With all computing devices that students use having multiple cores as well as a GPU in many cases, many students' favorite applications use multiple cores and/or distributed processors. However, we are still teaching them to solve problems using only sequential thinking. Why?This hands-on tutorial will demonstrate how easy it is to open students' eyes to exploiting concurrency in problem solving. You will participate in plugged and unplugged activities that will help students to recognize examples of PDC concepts and concurrency in the world around them. We introduce plugged and unplugged curriculum modules that have been successfully integrated in existing computing classes at multiple institutions. We will also discuss recent efforts at integrating AI methods, including LLMs, into introductory classes.A laptop capable of running a C/C++ compiler, a Java virtual environment, and a Python interpreter is needed to fully participate in activities. However, attendees may learn the core concepts without a laptop. The activities and curriculum modules have been used successfully to teach PDC concepts in early computing courses and will be available after the workshop. Participants will receive a stipend of 400 to defray their cost of registration and one-night hotel stay. The CDER center will also have a booth in the exhibition hall for additional support.},

abstract = {Integrating AI-driven tools in higher education is an emerging area with transformative potential. This paper introduces Iris, a chat-based virtual tutor integrated into the interactive learning platform Artemis that offers personalized, context-aware assistance in large-scale educational settings. Iris supports computer science students by guiding them through programming exercises and is designed to act as a tutor in a didactically meaningful way. Its calibrated assistance avoids revealing complete solutions, offering subtle hints or counter-questions to foster independent problem-solving skills. For each question, it issues multiple prompts in a Chain-of-Thought to GPT-3.5-Turbo. The prompts include a tutor role description and examples of meaningful answers through few-shot learning. Iris employs contextual awareness by accessing the problem statement, student code, and automated feedback to provide tailored advice. An empirical evaluation shows that students perceive Iris as effective because it understands their questions, provides relevant support, and contributes to the learning process. While students consider Iris a valuable tool for programming exercises and homework, they also feel confident solving programming tasks in computer-based exams without Iris. The findings underscore students' appreciation for Iris' immediate and personalized support, though students predominantly view it as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, human tutors. Nevertheless, Iris creates a space for students to ask questions without being judged by others.},

This calls for replication of studies and reexamination of findings from pre-GenAI CS contexts to understand the impact on students. Objectives: Achievement Goals are well studied in computing education and can be predictive of student interest and exam performance. The objective in this study is to compare findings from prior achievement goal studies in CS1 courses with new CS1 courses that emphasize the use of human-GenAI collaborative coding. Methods: In a CS1 course that integrates GenAI, we use linear regression to explore the relationship between achievement goals and prior experience on student interest, exam performance, and perceptions of GenAI. Results: As with prior findings in traditional CS1 classes, Mastery goals are correlated with interest in computing. Contradicting prior CS1 findings, normative goals are correlated with exam scores. Normative and mastery goals correlate with students’ perceptions of learning with GenAI. Mastery goals weakly correlate with reading and testing code output from GenAI.},

abstract = {Automated analysis of programming data using code representation methods offers valuable services for programmers, from code completion to clone detection to bug detection. Recent studies show the effectiveness of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), pre-trained Transformer-based models, and graph-based embeddings in programming code representation. However, pre-trained large language models lack interpretability, while other embedding-based approaches struggle with extracting important information from large ASTs. This study proposes a novel Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN) to address these gaps by integrating different components: an optimized sequential subtree extraction process using Genetic algorithm optimization, a two-way embedding approach, and an attention network. We investigate the effectiveness of SANN by applying it to two different tasks: program correctness prediction and algorithm detection on two educational datasets containing both small and large-scale code snippets written in Java and C, respectively. The experimental results show SANN's competitive performance against baseline models from the literature, including code2vec, ASTNN, TBCNN, CodeBERT, GPT-2, and MVG, regarding accurate predictive power. Finally, a case study is presented to show the interpretability of our model prediction and its application for an important human-centered computing application, student modeling. Our results indicate the effectiveness of the SANN model in capturing important syntactic and semantic information from students' code, allowing the construction of accurate student models, which serve as the foundation for generating adaptive instructional support such as individualized hints and feedback.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

abstract = {With the immense interest in ChatGPT worldwide, education has seen a mix of both excitement and skepticism. To properly evaluate its impact on education, it is crucial to understand how far it can help students without prior knowledge answer assessment questions. This study aims to address this question as well as the impact of the question type. We conducted multiple experiments with computer engineering students (experiment group: n=41 to 56), who were asked to use ChatGPT to answer previous test questions before learning about the related topics. Their scores were then compared with the scores of previous-term students who answered the same questions in a quiz or exam setting (control group: n=24 to 61). The results showed a wide range of effect sizes, from -2.55 to 1.23, depending on the question type and content. The experiment group performed best answering code analysis and conceptual questions but struggled with code completion and questions that involved images. However, the performance in code generation tasks was inconsistent. Overall, the ChatGPT group’s answers lagged slightly behind the control group’s answers with an effect size of -0.16. We conclude that ChatGPT, at least in the field of this study, is not yet ready to rely on by students who do not have sufficient background to evaluate generated answers. We suggest that educators try using ChatGPT and educate students on effective questioning techniques and how to assess the generated responses. This study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to SUMAC 2024, the 6th edition of the ACM workshop on analySis, Understanding and proMotion of heritAge Contents. The workshop focuses on analyzing, processing and valorizing all types of data related to cultural heritage, including tangible and intangible heritage. As stated by UNESCO, cultural heritage provides societies with a wealth of resources inherited from the past, created in the present for the benefit of future generations. The massive digitization of historical analogue resources and production of born-digital documents provide us with large volumes of varied multimedia heritage data (images, maps, text, video, 3D objects, multi-sensor data, etc.), which represent a rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide variety of fields, from research in social sciences and computational humanities to land use and territorial policies, including urban modeling, digital simulation, archaeology, tourism, education, culture preservation, creative media and entertainment. In terms of research in computer science, artificial intelligence and digital humanities, they address challenging problems related to the diversity, specificity or volume of the media, the veracity of the data, and different user needs with respect to engaging with this rich material and the extraction of value out of the data. These challenges are reflected in the corresponding sub-fields of machine learning, signal processing, multi-modal techniques and human-machine interaction, with special focus on:Analysis of historical data,Content understanding and pattern recognition,Linking and recommendation of multi-modal digital heritage,Human-machine interaction for big data analysis and visualization,Generative modeling of cultural heritage.},

abstract = {Objectives. Athletics and sports represent a focal part of adolescence for millions of youth around the world. However, opportunities to engage in computer science (CS) learning experiences are less prevalent, particularly among Hispanic and low-income communities. Recently, researchers have explored ways to bridge these, seemingly, disparate disciplines. Much of this prior research centers on the proliferation of sports technologies that support individualistic learning experiences. Additionally, many of these experiences are developed by researchers with limited design contributions from sports practitioners. To extend prior work, this project centers youth athletic identities and the associated cultural contexts of sports to explore ways that computing technologies can enhance and develop youth athletic identities and sports performance. Moreover, this work surfaces ways that athletics can be a generative and fulfilling space to learn about CS.Participants. In summer 2021, we collaborated with basketball coaches to design and implement a computing-enhanced learning experience with a basketball team of Hispanic participants in Puerto Rico. Eleven basketball athletes from a high school in southern Puerto Rico participated in the study. The participants have strong sports identities, as demonstrated by their lifelong engagement with team sports. Conversely, only one 1 of the 11 participants had experienced sports technologies, and none of them had previously participated in computing learning experiences.Study Method. In collaboration with local basketball coaches, we co-designed a learning experience that centers sports identities and practices and adds computing as a way to extend existing sports identities and local sports activities. We present and evaluate this learning experience using a design-based research approach. Participants’ feedback was collected in the form of surveys, designs, and journal entries, and additional data on their experiences were collected via videos and researchers’ field notes. Using a mixed-methods approach, we highlight existing participants’ identities and perceptions as well as their experiences with our design. We complement quantitative analysis of survey responses with case studies.Findings. We find that our design can provide shifts in youth student-athletes’ perceptions of computing. Additionally, hands-on experiences with computing tools enable participants to start practicing CS sensemaking via learning how different computing tools can support their sports performance individually and as a team. Furthermore, we find that the material, ideational, and relational resources made available through camp:bit supported each participant differently, while collectively providing a space for all of them to have meaningful and fulfilling experiences. Finally, we find that this design can foster and support sports team cohesion.Conclusions. We provide in-depth descriptions of our design, the youth’s engagement with it, and how these learning experiences can be further applied in sports spaces. These examples highlight a unique conception of practice-linked computational identities—where learners’ computational identities are grounded in a specific culturally relevant practice, enabling a more culturally sustaining computing learning experience. Finally, our analysis suggests five design principles for designing and conducting computing-supported learning experiences in sports environments. The principles are as follows: (1) Sports Experience: Authentically Support Existing Identities. (2) Team Dynamics: Team Athletes Are Part of a Whole. (3) Individual Pursuits: Supporting Individual Paths. (4) Direct Interactions: Conversations with Materials and Ideas. (5) Interdisciplinary Facilitation Team: Complementary Skills. These design principles can be used by researchers, practitioners, and local stakeholders to implement sport-centric CS learning experiences to extend and enhance the way student-athletes from marginalized communities practice sports, as well as to activate interest and engagement in CS.},

abstract = {Catalyzed by the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, policymakers worldwide have launched a surge of activity surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The legal and policy frameworks emerging from this concentrated period of attention may shape AI governance for decades to come. This keynote will examine the implications of these global AI policy debates for computing educators and their students.  Drawing on the speaker's dual experience as a computing educator and AI policy adviser within the United States Senate, this presentation will explore the developing threads of AI policy that educators should integrate into their curricula to prepare students for an evolving socio-technical landscape.  The talk will present an overview of significant AI policy developments, including the European Union's AI Act, the over 120 AI-related bills currently pending in the United States Congress, and the United Arab Emirates' launch of a state-of-the-art open-source AI model. These examples will be contextualized within the history of how the current active regulatory stance diverges from prior approaches to technologies like the internet and social media, and consider the potential implications of this shift.  Equally important to understanding how AI policy is evolving is understanding why. Many legislative efforts are driven by concerns about AI's potential to exacerbate societal harms, such as election misinformation, cybersecurity threats, nonconsensual sexual imagery, weapons development, data privacy violations, intellectual property appropriation, labor market disruptions, and algorithmic biases. Coupled with these concerns is a widespread skepticism toward the tech industry's capacity for responsible self-governance. This context underscores the need for computing educators to engage students on issues of policy, ethics, and justice throughout the curriculum, to cultivate future professionals who can earn public trust and who appreciate the role of governments in establishing balance between innovation and safety guardrails.  Finally, the talk will offer reflections on the experience of serving as a technical adviser to policymakers, and advocate for computing educators to consider public service engagement on AI policy as a compelling career trajectory for themselves and their students.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) has seen great advancements in the past two years and the conversation around adoption is increasing. Widely available GenAI tools are disrupting classroom practices as they can write and explain code with minimal student prompting. While most acknowledge that there is no way to stop students from using such tools, a consensus has yet to form on how students should use them if they choose to do so. At the same time, researchers have begun to introduce new pedagogical tools that integrate GenAI into computing curricula. These new tools offer students personalized help or attempt to teach prompting skills without undercutting code comprehension. This working group aims to detail the current landscape of education-focused GenAI tools and teaching approaches, present gaps where new tools or approaches could appear, identify good practice-examples, and provide a guide for instructors to utilize GenAI as they continue to adapt to this new era.},

Codex is also the underlying model for GitHub Copilot, a plugin which makes AI-generated code accessible to students through auto-completion in popular code editors. Research in this area, particularly on the educational implications, is nascent and has focused almost exclusively on introductory programming (or CS1) questions. Very recent work has shown that Codex performs considerably better on typical CS1 exam questions than most students. It is not clear, however, what Codex’s limits are with regard to more complex programming assignments and exams. In this paper, we present results detailing how Codex performs on more advanced CS2 (data structures and algorithms) exam questions taken from past exams. We compare these results to those of students who took the same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We consider the implications of such tools for the future of undergraduate computing education.},

While scholars have looked at overall institutional guidance for the use of GenAI and reports have documented the response from schools in the form of broad guidance to instructors, we do not know what policies and practices instructors are actually adopting and how they are being communicated to students through course syllabi. To study instructors' policy guidance, we collected 98 computing course syllabi from 54 R1 institutions in the U.S. and studied the GenAI policies they adopted and the surrounding discourse. Our analysis shows that 1) most instructions related to GenAI use were as part of the academic integrity policy for the course and 2) most syllabi prohibited or restricted GenAI use, often warning students about the broader implications of using GenAI, e.g. lack of veracity, privacy risks, and hindering learning. Beyond this, there was wide variation in how instructors approached GenAI including a focus on how to cite GenAI use, conceptualizing GenAI as an assistant, often in an anthropomorphic manner, and mentioning specific GenAI tools for use. We discuss the implications of our findings and conclude with current best practices for instructors.},

The game is powered by nested dictionary (JSON) objects that store pre-existing scenes. Each scene is a nested dictionary, containing user choices, descriptions, and more. Students are challenged to navigate and manipulate these deeply nested data structures, which helps them appreciate the utility and complexity of dictionary objects. When a user ventures into an undefined scene, the program makes an API call to ChatGPT to generate the next scene, allowing the adventure to continue seamlessly. To the best of our knowledge it is one of the first assignments in intro CS that uses ChatGPT. What makes this assignment truly nifty is how it teaches students to leverage generative AI in a creative, meaningful way. By blending generative storytelling with technical skills, students get to see the power of AI in extending their projects beyond predefined boundaries, creating an open-ended, exciting experience. Many students expanded on this assignment for their final projects, creating sophisticated programs like AI-driven Chess and Go games. Using the techniques from this assignment, they leveraged the course's OpenAI integration to build functional AI agents that enhanced gameplay. These projects showcased the flexibility of the assignment, inspiring students to think critically about the creative and practical applications of AI in real-world contexts.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have led to the emergence of generative AI models that exhibit extraordinary performance at producing human-like outputs. Using only simple input prompts, it is possible to generate novel text, images, video, music, and source code, as well as tackle tasks such as answering questions and translating and summarising text.However, the potential for these models to impact computing education practice is only just beginning to be explored. For example, novices learning to code can now use free tools that automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments; yet these tools were not designed with novices in mind and little to nothing is known about how they will impact learning. Furthermore, much attention has focused on the immediate challenges these models present, such as academic integrity concerns. It seems that even in the AI-era a pending apocalypse sells better than a promising renaissance.Generative AI will likely play an increasing role in people's lives in the reasonably foreseeable future. Model performance seems set to continue accelerating while novel uses and new possibilities multiply. Given this, we should devote just as much effort to identifying and exploiting new opportunities as we do to identifying and mitigating challenges.In this talk, we begin by discussing several concrete and research-backed opportunities for computing educators. Many of these have already shown great promise in positively impacting current practice. We then discuss more short- to medium-term possibilities in areas such as student recruitment, and curricular changes. Finally - against our better judgement - we speculate over the longer-term, including rethinking the very fundamentals of the practice of teaching introductory and advanced computing courses. In these discussions we suggest potential research questions and directions. Although making remotely accurate predictions in such a fast-changing landscape is foolhardy, we believe that now is the time to explore and embrace opportunities to help make positive change in as many computing classrooms as possible.},

Our research focuses on three areas: curriculum, teacher-professional learning and policy. The denouement of this aims to identify trends and shortfalls for AI in and for K-12 informatics education. We will systematically review the current literature to identify themes and emerging trends in AI education at K-12. This will be done under two facets, curricula and teacher-professional learning. In addition, we will conduct interviews and surveys with educators and AI experts. Next, we will examine the current policy (such as the European AI Act, and European Commission guidelines on the use of AI and data in education and training as well as international counterparts). Policies are often developed by both educators and experts in the domain, thus providing a source of topics or areas that may be added to our findings. Finally, by synthesising insights from educators, AI experts, and policymakers, as well as the literature and policy, our working group seeks to highlight possible future trends and shortfalls.},

However, little work has been done to investigate the applicability of GPT to teaching assembly language. In this paper, we fill in the gap by providing an empirical study of GPT's ability to interpret assembly instructions. In particular, we manually evaluated GPT-4's per-instruction explanations of code segments for four different computer architectures, namely x86, x86-64, ARM, and AArch64. Our study shows that, while inconsistencies and rare errors do exist, GPT's interpretations are highly accurate in general, demonstrating a great potential for such tools to be applied in pedagogical practices for tutoring assembly language.},

Provided with a natural language description of a programming problem as input, Codex generates solution code as output. It can also explain (in English) input code, translate code between programming languages, and more. In this work, we explore how Codex performs on typical introductory programming problems. We report its performance on real questions taken from introductory programming exams and compare it to results from students who took these same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We then explore how Codex handles subtle variations in problem wording using several published variants of the well-known “Rainfall Problem” along with one unpublished variant we have used in our teaching. We find the model passes many test cases for all variants. We also explore how much variation there is in the Codex generated solutions, observing that an identical input prompt frequently leads to very different solutions in terms of algorithmic approach and code length. Finally, we discuss the implications that such technology will have for computing education as it continues to evolve, including both challenges and opportunities.},

abstract = {Investigation of students’ perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking. In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly. We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall ‘23, winter ‘23, and spring ‘24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time. We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.},

abstract = {Although CS educators have studied the potential of generative AI for years, the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked a wave of uncertainty and anxiety. With students arriving at university already experienced with using ChatGPT for work across the academic spectrum, educators were under pressure to somehow address the presence of this new resource in their classroom. This article describes both the “climate of fear” surrounding ChatGPT’s impacts on education and an attempt by the authors to induct ChatGPT as a colleague instead of an adversary. While creating a video series where we used ChatGPT to generate practice exercises for CS1 and CS2, we found it to be patient, charismatic and friendly, but also sometimes obstinate, misinformed, stubborn and confused; in other words, it was surprisingly human.},

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical way that students learn new concepts, acquire new skills, and get unstuck when problem-solving in their computing courses. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers students a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it is unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources along dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing students now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected survey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our results suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have not yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources that students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors. Finally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with generative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate benefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We discuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing classrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.},

abstract = {External help resources are frequently used by novice programmers solving classwork in undergraduate computing courses. Traditionally, these tools consisted of web resources such as tutorial websites and Q&amp;A forums. With the rise of Generative AI (GenAI), there has been increasing concern and research about how external resources should be used in the classroom. However, little work has directly contrasted student beliefs and perceptions of web resources with GenAI, has grounded these beliefs in prior psychological theory, and has investigated how demographic factors and student backgrounds influence these beliefs and intentions. We administered a vignette-style survey across two courses required for a CS major at an R1 University, a freshman (n = 152) and senior capstone course (n = 44). Students responded to likert questions aiming to measure behavioral factors related to these tools, such as intention to use, perceived attitudes, peer perceptions, and their own perceived tool competency. We primarily investigate the results of an introductory course, finding that novices have a wide range of opinions on both resources, but overall find them slightly useful and have a tendency to prefer web-search. We compare this with seniors, who have more positive perceptions of these tools, and discuss possible reasons and implications for this difference. We constructed two path models to investigate which factors strongly influence novices’ intention to use resources and find the primary factor to be their general attitudes in how these tools will result in a positive or negative outcome (e.g. perceived benefits, justifiability). We also measure the effects of student background on intention to use these resources. Finally, we discuss implications and suggestions on how instructors can use this information to approach, address, and influence resource usage in their classrooms.},

abstract = {Over the past year (2022–2023), recently-released AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have gained significant attention from computing educators. Both researchers and practitioners have discovered that these tools can generate correct solutions to a variety of introductory programming assignments and accurately explain the contents of code. Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs. Our study findings capture a rare snapshot in time in early 2023 as computing instructors are just starting to form opinions about this fast-growing phenomenon but have not yet converged to any consensus about best practices. Using these findings as inspiration, we synthesized a diverse set of open research questions regarding how to develop, deploy, and evaluate AI coding tools for computing education.},

abstract = {The excitement around ChatGPT 3.5 underscores its potential to transform various fields in education, including STEM. However, we must approach these claims cautiously. While AI can enhance STEM education, there are ethical concerns and potential inaccuracies linked to unsupervised automated responses. To comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT's influence on STEM, we conducted a controlled experiment that involved answering a question set in mathematics and CS in a time-limited session. To avoid bias, we recruited four groups of math and CS students with similar abilities -each group comprised five students. Two groups utilized ChatGPT, while the other two did not. Students who used ChatGPT were tasked with explaining how and where they employed the tool. Conversely, students who did not use ChatGPT were asked to showcase their problem-solving process. We analyzed the responses from these four groups, alongside the analysis of ChatGPT conversations for those who employed ChatGPT. Performance, confidence level, and completion time of each participant were recorded. Experts in mathematics and CS were then consulted to review participant responses. These experts were subsequently interviewed to gain deeper insights and draw conclusive findings. Our findings show that students who didn't use ChatGPT in Mathematics scored better than those who did, Specifically, ChatGPT provided the correct working process but yielded a wrong final answer due to arithmetic mistakes. Similarly, in programming, ChatGPT led to less elegant code. Our findings provide valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of AI integration in these fields, helping educators and students to adapt to AI advancements.},

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving Generative AI (GenAI) landscape, source code and natural language are being mixed and used in new ways. This presents opportunities for rethinking teaching practice in Introductory Programming (CS1) courses that includes, but goes beyond, assessment. In this paper we examine the reasons why and how instructors who are early adopters of GenAI are using it in their teaching, and why others are not. We also explore the changes and adaptations that are currently being made to practice. This is achieved by synthesizing insights from several recent studies that have collected primary data from introductory programming instructors who are teaching with, considering teaching with, or actively not teaching with GenAI.Due to the fast pace of GenAI development and adoption, the fixed-pace and cyclical nature of education, and the relatively slow pace of research (including ethical approvals) and publication cycles, research with primary data from instructors is only being published relatively recently. In computing education, there is not yet enough published research with primary data from CS1 instructors to warrant a systematic literature review, although in the next year this will likely be possible. Based on an analysis of the nascent research that has been published, we propose emerging and flexible guidelines on how CS1 instructors could adapt their practice based on what others have done so far. These guidelines highlight important factors to consider when integrating GenAI in CS1 courses, which for many is only beginning.},

Recent research has shown that many students are aware of generative AI (GenAI) tools; however, there are gaps in the extent and effectiveness of how students use them. With over two years of widespread GenAI usage, it is crucial to understand whether students' help-seeking behaviors with these tools have evolved and how. This paper presents findings from a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted among computing students across North American universities ( n=95 ). Our results indicate shifts in GenAI usage patterns. In 2023, 34.1% of students ( n=47 ) reported never using ChatGPT for help, ranking it fourth after online searches, peer support, and class forums. By 2024, this figure dropped sharply to 6.3% ( n=48 ), with ChatGPT nearly matching online search as the most commonly used help resource. Despite this growing prevalence, there has been a decline in students' hourly and daily usage of GenAI tools, which may be attributed to a common tendency to underestimate usage frequency. These findings offer new insights into the evolving role of GenAI in computing education, highlighting its increasing acceptance and solidifying its position as a key help resource.},

Problem: Understanding the capabilities and limitations of these chatbots is a significant challenge, particularly as they are integrated into different information systems, including those in education. Solution: In this study, we conducted a quantitative assessment of the ability of two prominent chatbots, ChatGPT and Bard, to solve POSCOMP questions. IS Theory: The IS theory used in this work is Information processing theory. Method: We used a total of 271 questions from the last five POSCOMP exams that did not rely on graphic content as our materials. We presented these questions to the two chatbots in two formats: directly as they appeared in the exam and with additional context. In the latter case, the chatbots were informed that they were answering a multiple-choice question from a computing exam. Summary of Results: On average, chatbots outperformed human exam-takers by more than 20%. Interestingly, both chatbots performed better, in average, without additional context added to the prompt. They exhibited similar performance levels, with a slight advantage observed for ChatGPT. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The primary contribution to the field involves the exploration of the capabilities and limitations of chatbots in addressing computing-related questions. This information is valuable for individuals developing Information Systems with the assistance of such chatbots or those relying on technologies built upon these capabilities.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented development of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the teaching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning for the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and informal contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rapid advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges for the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show potential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences and outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empirical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topics (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that examine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instructional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventions at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on student learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome studies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholders' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interactions with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using generative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at scale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support learning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, tangible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of existing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Research that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from underrepresented groups.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) has become ubiquitous in daily life, including classroom environments where students are using it to assist them on their coursework. Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

Although CS1 is well studied, relatively few broadly-scoped studies have been conducted, and none prior have exceeded regional scale. In addition, CS1 is a notoriously fickle and often changing course, and many might find it beneficial to know what other instructors are doing across the globe; perhaps more so as we continue to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on computing education and as the effects of Generative AI take hold. Expanding upon several surveys conducted in Australasia, the UK, and Ireland, this survey facilitates a direct comparison of global trends in CS1. The survey goes beyond environmental factors such as languages used, and examines why CS1 instructors teach what they do, in the ways they do. In total the survey spans 84 institutions and 91 courses in which a total of over 40,000 students are enrolled.},

abstract = {Generative AI is a recent breakthrough in AI. While it has become a hot topic in computing education research (CER), much of the recent research has focused on e.g. issues of plagiarism or academic integrity. One problem spot with Generative AI is its susceptibility to various kinds of algorithmic bias. In this study, we collected data from an introductory computing course, where students experimented with text-to-image generative models and reflected on their generated image sets, in terms of biases, related harms, and possible fixes. Data were collected in Fall 2023 (pilot data in Fall 2022). Data included reports from 163 students. The results show (1) a variety of bias types observed by students related to gender, ethnicity, age, as well as a variety of bias types not observed by students, (2) two major types of attributions for the source of bias: bias caused by biases in the society and bias caused by data or algorithms, and (3) a number of potential harms associated with the biases, as well as attributions of those harms in specific contexts and use cases.},

abstract = {Introductory programming courses often emphasize mastering syntax and basic constructs before progressing to more complex and interesting programs. This bottom-up approach can be frustrating for novices, shifting the focus away from problem solving and potentially making computing less appealing to a broad range of students. The rise of generative AI for code production could partially address these issues by fostering new skills via interaction with AI models, including constructing high-level prompts and evaluating code that is automatically generated. In this experience report, we explore the inclusion of two prompt-focused activities in an introductory course, implemented across four labs in a six-week module. The first requires students to solve computational problems by writing natural language prompts, emphasizing problem-solving over syntax. The second involves students crafting prompts to generate code equivalent to provided fragments, to foster an understanding of the relationship between prompts and code. Most of the students in the course had reported finding programming difficult to learn, often citing frustrations with syntax and debugging. We found that self-reported difficulty with learning programming had a strong inverse relationship with performance on traditional programming assessments such as tests and projects, as expected. However, performance on the natural language tasks was less strongly related to self-reported difficulty, suggesting they may target different skills. Learning how to communicate with AI coding models is becoming an important skill, and natural language prompting tasks may appeal to a broad range of students.},

abstract = {Automated assistance for detecting cheating on programs has long been investigated by CS educators, especially with the rise of "homework help" websites over the past decade, and recently with AI tools like ChatGPT. The main detection approach has long been flagging similar submission pairs. Modern cheating, like hiring contractors or using ChatGPT, may not yield such similarity. And, cases based on similarity alone may be weak. Thus, over the past several years, building on logs from an online program auto-grader (zyBooks), we developed additional "cheating concern metrics": points rate, style anomalies, style inconsistencies, IP address anomalies, code replacements, and initial copying. Most are defined not only for one programming assignment but also across a set of assignments. The metrics can help catch more kinds of cheating, provide more compelling evidence of cheating, reduce false cheating accusations based on similarity alone, and help instructors focus their limited cheat-detection time on the most egregious cases. We describe the techniques, and our experiences (via our own Python scripts and a commercial tool) for several terms, showing benefits of having more metrics than just similarity. Of 30 cheating cases over 3 terms and 300 students, most were based on metrics beyond similarity, all students admitted, none later contested, and time per student was only 1-2 hours (far less than previously). Our goal is to prevent cheating in the first place, by reducing opportunity via strong detection tools, as part of a multi-faceted approach to having students truly learn and stay out of trouble.},

abstract = {The Latinx community is underrepresented in tech-oriented fields, which aligns with the lack of culturally relevant learning experiences in CS for Latinx youth, hindering their ability to conceptualize technology as a tool for transformation and vehicle for cultural expression. This study takes on a restorying approach at the elementary level, where 9 fourth-grade students engaged in focus group discussions over three days to generate prompts for a generative AI art. Through the lens of restorying, the prompts had students conceptualize a future with a focus on their Mexican-American heritage, local community, and technology. The study revealed that students associated their heritage with symbolic representations such as food and music, and characterized the community as a commercialized space while also emphasizing locations conducive to family-oriented activities. As a result, technology in community spaces was associated with consumerism. However, when envisioning a futuristic, transformed community, they made deeper connections between the role of technology in the community, making intricate connections between community improvements and technology-based solutions. This underscores the need for computing education to dedicate time for young learners to reflect on the role technology has on their current culture and community to make deeper connections.},

In this project, we established a working group of practising computing teachers to bring together a range of views and experiences. Initial results of the project led to a booklet for computing teachers on how to use GenAI, illustrating the effectiveness of teacher-researcher partnerships in developing resources for school use.

abstract = {Problem decomposition is an important skill in programming, allowing learners to break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals. However, translating these subgoals into executable code poses a significant challenge for novice programmers. In this study conducted in an introductory programming course, learners received instruction in stepwise refinement and integration of AI-generated code within their assignments. Throughout the course, learners were permitted to rely on AI code generators, following opportunities to receive feedback on their ability to read and write code without AI assistance.  Our findings show that learners frequently relied on AI-generated code when working on assignments outside the classroom, but that the frequency of reliance varied from one assignment to another. The reliance on AI-generated code was not correlated with the learners' year in their degree, nor whether they were enrolled in a CS degree or not. Instead, it was associated with their prior knowledge, as learners who were less proficient in reading and writing code were more likely to seek AI assistance.  AI tools were primarily used to translate subgoals into code, fix errors, and explain algorithmic concepts. Few learners encountered difficulties in understanding or integrating AI generated code into their solutions. Overall, learner performance in meeting assignment requirements was relatively high, regardless of their prior knowledge or reliance on AI code generators. We conclude that leveraging the capabilities of generative AI can effectively bridge the gap between problem-solving and implementation, enabling learners to engage in skills that might otherwise be beyond their reach.},

abstract = {This paper critically examines persistent inequities in existing computing faculty hiring and retention practices, which gravely impact computing educators from marginalized groups. Throughout these processes, applicants fight against multiple systemic barriers, including but not limited to, biased job ads and discriminatory interview practices. The increasing use of generative AI tools to aid in tasks connected to the hiring process, such as writing recommendation letters, exacerbates these biases. The inequities persist despite global initiatives and legal mandates and serve as a direct contradiction to widespread institutional commitments to diversity and inclusion. By building on literature and the lived experiences of the SIGCSE community represented in a recent Technical Symposium session, we raise concerns about the different stages of this process, highlighting the importance of clear expectations and adequate support. The paper concludes with a call to align hiring practices with inclusive institutional values, requiring the academic community to reflect on and revise hiring policies for a more equitable future. It is of paramount importance to address the role of these practices in the erosion of marginalized communities from the computing education community, a marginalization that occurs in many different contexts and negatively impacts everyone involved.},

It invited them to consider the use of computing technologies in their social-design projects, and to reflect critically on their work. The design was structured with an ad hoc toolkit with various building materials, including cards for reflecting, and physical-computing devices for rapidly prototyping design ideas. The purpose of the toolkit is, on the one hand, to structure and constrain the generative design process and, on the other hand, to allow a certain degree of expressiveness and freedom to participants. The article reports the results of the case study and concludes with a discussion of how to engage non-computing experts in such a process, balancing freedom and guidance.},

abstract = {Non-native English speakers (NNES) face multiple barriers to learning programming. These barriers can be obvious, such as the fact that programming language syntax and instruction are often in English, or more subtle, such as being afraid to ask for help in a classroom full of native English speakers. However, these barriers are frustrating because many NNES students know more about programming than they can articulate in English. Advances in generative AI (GenAI) have the potential to break down these barriers because state of the art models can support interactions in multiple languages. Moreover, recent work has shown that GenAI can be highly accurate at code generation and explanation. In this paper, we provide the first exploration of NNES students prompting in their native languages (Arabic, Chinese, and Portuguese) to generate code to solve programming problems. Our results show that students are able to successfully use their native language to solve programming problems, but not without some difficulty specifying programming terminology and concepts. We discuss the challenges they faced, the implications for practice in the short term, and how this might transform computing education globally in the long term.},

abstract = {As data corpus-driven tools and technologies increasingly push users to passively search for an answer, rather than search to understand, we believe that technical and computing disciplinary writing courses have a duty to teach the process of responsible data storytelling. While students can grasp that generative AI makes mistakes, hallucinates, and perpetuates bias, they can need help understanding the antecedent causes of those difficulties. All algorithmically driven decision-making or recommending software have in common a large data set that has been labeled, either by users or by the system itself. The origins of that data and the reasonable applications/deductions and conclusions possible for any given dataset have everything to do with why some tools help and some tools perpetuate harms. By starting at the very beginning and asking students to make sense of data, students can more easily see how purpose and audience impact analysis of any given collection of data. Once those opportunities for rhetorical choice making are known, students become ready to understand the connection between data and complex A.I. systems and some of the ways that bias and other kinds of harm can result if designers are not careful. Combining instruction in a technical coding environment with basic data literacy lessons such as ‘the seven data stories,’ [14] we developed and delivered a three-week writing unit designed around responsible data exploration and storytelling. In this experience report, we provide the assignment we used, and the scaffolded activities we employed to bring students through the process, remarking on what worked well and what we want to improve. We provide attendees with a link to an R-based notebook with a walk-through lesson on data exploration commands, and the rubric used to assess students’ texts, notebooks with code and commentary and results, all existing in a referential context. We provide the survey results of students’ perception of learning from this activity. Early findings demonstrate that students internalized lessons about the non-objective nature of data analysis and of specific responsible data storytelling practices required by anyone seeking to ethically represent answers within and limitations of any dataset.},
