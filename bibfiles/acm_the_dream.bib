abstract = {New breakthroughs in code synthesis from Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms are driving significant changes to software engineering education. Having algorithms able to generate components of a software project means that software developers will need stronger skills in requirements specification to guide code generation as well as stronger skills in code review, testing, and integration to incorporate AI-generated code into projects. Shifts in industry and classroom practices are already occurring with the availability of inline code generation tools like GitHub's Copilot, which makes discussion of pedagogical strategies in this area a timely topic. Of immediate concern in computer science education is the potential for LLM-generated code and code help to undermine the learning of CS students. In order to avoid such undermining in even intentional uses of LLM-enhanced learning supports, it is necessary to clarify the roles such supports need to play in the pedagogical process. The Computer Science Matrix Taxonomy provides a strong framework for organizing software testing learning outcomes as well as delineating the operational space in which LLM-based feedback tools should operate to support those learning outcomes. In this paper, the authors operationalize the CS Matrix Taxonomy for software testing learning outcomes and illustrate the integration of LLM-generated test strategy suggestions as an extension of the peer coding/testing model. The work includes examples of AI-generated code testing suggestions that students would use to help guide their own code synthesis for assignments or projects.},

This manuscript introduces a fresh methodology for teaching CS1 or CS2 courses, concentrating specifically on the fundamental principles of Java programming. Harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT, an AI language model, we delve into how integrating conversational AI into the classroom milieu can foster a more dynamic and tailored learning journey. By furnishing a platform for students to pose inquiries, seek elucidation, and promptly receive feedback, ChatGPT functions as a virtual mentor, complementing conventional teaching methodologies. We scrutinize the potential repercussions of this approach on student learning outcomes (SLOs) and juxtapose it with traditional classroom paradigms. Furthermore, we deliberate on the ramifications of employing AI in education and its contribution to molding the trajectory of introductory programming courses.},

abstract = {The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.},

abstract = {This paper explores how Generative AI (GenAI) can be introduced within summative assessment components in software engineering education. We present an example of an assessment which allows learners to use GenAI in a freeform, constructionist manner, as part of a large, software development project. This work is inspired by previously executed AI-focused assessments and surveys, which explicitly indicate that learners on an Applied Software Engineering Degree Apprenticeship Programme want to formally learn how to use GenAI tools when programming and their employers want to see these skills from graduates. The learning outcome of the assignment was for learners to explore a typical developmental pipeline as a solo developer, moving from design to development to finished product. Learners were marked exclusively on their end product and understanding of application components, not the written code itself, resulting in an assessment where the end product and project were prioritised over foundational code (which was adequately assessed in other components). The results show that all learners used GenAI to some extent during their project, and in all cases, they found it beneficial for large programming tasks. Learners were generally able to produce a larger, more comprehensive and more ambitious project, compared to previous years. It is proposed that removing the barrier to GenAI - and demystifying it - can encourage a constructionist approach to its use, and normalise it as a potential tool for programming.},

Recent work showed novice programmers struggle with prompting LLMs for code generation and suggested that the use of LLMs in CS education could exacerbate existing equity issues. Educators are now faced with the difficult question of whether and when to incorporate the use of LLMs into the CS curriculum without adversely impacting student learning and equity. To address these concerns, we study the effects of using an interactive LLM on code generation with novice programmers. We find that using our interactive LLM improves the accuracy of code generation over the baseline LLM. Additionally, after using the interactive LLM, novices write improved prompts even when using the baseline LLM. Based on our findings, we plan to create iGPTs, a set of customized, interactive LLMs spanning CS education learning goals as templates to facilitate LLM integration for improving student learning and retention.},

abstract = {As the prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows in various sectors, their potential in education warrants exploration. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly better at a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks (NLP), such as text generation and understanding. Recently, these models have extended their capabilities to coding tasks, bridging the gap between natural languages (NL) and programming languages (PL). Foundational models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and LLaMA series have set strong baseline performances in various NL and PL tasks. Additionally, several models have been fine-tuned specifically for code generation, showing significant improvements in code-related applications. Both foundational and fine-tuned models are increasingly used in education, helping students write, debug, and understand code. We present a comprehensive systematic literature review to examine the impact of LLMs in computer science and computer engineering education. We analyze their effectiveness in enhancing the learning experience, supporting personalized education, and aiding educators in curriculum development. We address five research questions to uncover insights into how LLMs contribute to educational outcomes, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research.},

Findings reveal a positive association between the number of attempts and help requests, indicating more engaged students seek assistance. STM analysis shows high-ability students address abstract concepts early, while lower-ability students focus on syntax-related issues.

We present our preliminary work on developing prompt-engineering strategies to mitigate bias in content generated by LLMs in computer science (CS) education. This work investigates both empirical insights into fairness-aware prompt formulation and actionable takeaways for educators. We focus on an initial list of prompting strategies for mitigating bias and explore their impact on educational content generation. Recent research has shown the efficacy of prompt-base debiasing [1] as well as the potential disadvantages of using prompts that have not been mitigated for bias, from user dissatisfaction [2] to unsafe outputs [5, 6]. Additionally, a growing body of empirical work points to the idea that certain properties of in-context examples such as flow [7], illustration [3], and order [4] could either improve or derail LLM performance. Our study leverages these findings in the context of generating educational content. The goal is to promote fairness-aware approaches which can be applied to the automated generation of learning materials and the development of LLM-based educational tools. This work also contributes practical insights on prompt-engineering to the evolving curriculum of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI).},

abstract = {Software testing is a challenging topic in software engineering education and requires creative approaches to engage learners. For example, the Code Defenders game has students compete over a Java class under test by writing effective tests and mutants. While such gamified approaches deal with problems of motivation and engagement, students may nevertheless require help to put testing concepts into practice. The recent widespread diffusion of Generative AI and Large Language Models raises the question of whether and how these disruptive technologies could address this problem, for example, by providing explanations of unclear topics and guidance for writing tests. However, such technologies might also be misused or produce inaccurate answers, which would negatively impact learning. To shed more light on this situation, we conducted the first empirical study investigating how students learn and practice new software testing concepts in the context of the Code Defenders testing game, supported by a smart assistant based on a widely known, commercial Large Language Model. Our study shows that students had unrealistic expectations about the smart assistant, “blindly” trusting any output it generated, and often trying to use it to obtain solutions for testing exercises directly. Consequently, students who resorted to the smart assistant more often were less effective and efficient than those who did not. For instance, they wrote 8.6% fewer tests, and their tests were not useful in 78.0% of the cases. We conclude that giving unrestricted and unguided access to Large Language Models might generally impair learning. Thus, we believe our study helps to raise awareness about the implications of using Generative AI and Large Language Models in Computer Science Education and provides guidance towards developing better and smarter learning tools.},

We identify the new challenges that the software engineering community has to address in the coming years to successfully apply artificial intelligence in software engineering, and we share our research roadmap toward the effective use of artificial intelligence in the software engineering profession, while still protecting fundamental human values.We spotlight three main areas that challenge the research in software engineering: the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models for engineering large software systems, the need of large and unbiased datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating deep learning and large language models for software engineering, and the need of a new code of digital ethics to apply artificial intelligence in software engineering.},

Thus, little is known about using large language models towards curriculum development and teacher supports outside of the college setting. Given the emphasis placed on culturally responsive teaching at the K-8 level and well-documented evidence of insensitive and inaccurate language model outputs from a cultural perspective, it is imperative to perform systematic and principled research before considering their use in this setting.This paper explores the potential of teachers using large language models to brainstorm instructional Scratch projects. Specifically, we use GPT-3 to mimic structured projects from an existing computer science curriculum but situate the generated projects in different contexts/themes. We qualitatively analyze 300 project ideas generated by GPT and find 81% of the generated ideas satisfy our metrics for technical alignment and theme quality. We identify two major weaknesses: code complexity of generated projects and presence of potential insensitive elements that would require human filtering. We conclude that, while not ready as a student-facing solution, teachers could use GPT to effectively brainstorm customized instructional materials.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become widely popular for various software engineering tasks, including programming, testing, code review, and program comprehension. However, their impact on improving software quality in educational settings remains uncertain. This article explores our experience teaching the use of Programming Mistake Detector (PMD) to foster a culture of bug fixing and leverage LLM to improve software quality in the classroom. This article discusses the results of an experiment involving 155 submissions that carried out a code review activity of 1,658 rules. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that a set of PMD quality issues influences the acceptance or rejection of the issues, and design-related categories that take longer to resolve. Although students acknowledge the potential of using ChatGPT during code review, some skepticism persists. Further, constructing prompts for ChatGPT that possess clarity, complexity, and context nurtures vital learning outcomes, such as enhanced critical thinking, and among the 1,658 issues analyzed, 93% of students indicated that ChatGPT did not identify any additional issues beyond those detected by PMD. Conversations between students and ChatGPT encompass five categories, including ChatGPT’s use of affirmation phrases like “certainly” regarding bug fixing decisions, and apology phrases such as “apologize” when resolving challenges. Through this experiment, we demonstrate that code review can become an integral part of the educational computing curriculum. We envision our findings to enable educators to support students with effective code review strategies, increasing awareness of LLMs, and promoting software quality in education.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has raised concerns among computer science educators about how programming assignments should be adapted. This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude Sonnet) in solving complete, multi-part CS homework assignments from the SIGCSE Nifty Assignments list. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we found that LLM performance varied significantly across different assignments and models, with Claude Sonnet consistently outperforming the others. The presence of starter code and test cases improved performance for advanced LLMs, while certain assignments, particularly those involving visual elements, proved challenging for all models. LLMs often disregarded assignment requirements, produced subtly incorrect code, and struggled with context-specific tasks. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for designing LLM-resistant assignments. Our work provides insights for instructors to evaluate and adapt their assignments in the age of AI, balancing the potential benefits of LLMs as learning tools with the need to ensure genuine student engagement and learning.},

ChatGPT's usage in tasks such as solving assignments and exams has the potential to undermine students' learning outcomes and compromise academic integrity. This study adopts a quantitative approach to demonstrate the notable unreliability of ChatGPT in providing accurate answers to a wide range of questions within the field of undergraduate computer science. While the majority of existing research has concentrated on assessing the performance of Large Language Models in handling programming assignments, our study adopts a more comprehensive approach. Specifically, we evaluate various types of questions such as true/false, multi-choice, multi-select, short answer, long answer, design-based, and coding-related questions. Our evaluation highlights the potential consequences of students excessively relying on ChatGPT for the completion of assignments and exams, including self-sabotage.

abstract = {SQL stands as the foundational language for data analysis and manipulation, playing a pivotal role in the database learning process. Proficiency in SQL is essential for students seeking to excel in data-related fields. However, the conventional approaches to assessing SQL queries rely heavily on manual grading, and the automated assessment tools are usually producing only binary decisions for the submitted queries. Our primary research objective is to develop effective methods for evaluating the quality of the SQL queries. To meet this objective, we introduce two approaches: structure-based analysis and evaluation by an instruction tuned large language model (LLM). The first approach deconstructs queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and employs cosine similarity to assess student submissions. The second approach utilizes a pre-trained LLM: FLAN-T5, fine-tuned for predicting the quality of student submissions. These methodologies are tested on a SQL dataset, and our experimental findings evaluate against a grading rubric with categories ranging from "good" to "unacceptable". The experimental results demonstrate that we can enhance the grading efficiency by applying these approaches and illustrate the ability of utilizing LLM to classify the assessed SQL statements more accurately. In addition, this research contributes to Computer Science (CS) education by integrating these approaches into our team's automated SQL statement assessment tool, improving the learning experience and evaluation process.},

However, the disagreement between human graders and LLMs is often considered too large for practical adoption. In this paper, we investigate the real-world impact of this disagreement on final grades. Instead of focusing on individual answers, we simulate the grading process of an entire exam. We use an unmodified LLM (OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo) with one-shot prompting for grading individual answers to short answer questions from computer science courses at a German university. Our main contributions are the evaluation of the real-world impact on examination grades in contrast to correctness of individual student answers, the simulation of grading strategies common in human grading practice, and the discussion of the results in the context of observed inter-rater variabilities among human graders. The findings confirm the natural expectation that the impact of the disagreement is lower for final grades than when looking at individual answers. We quantify this effect and compare it to a grading obtained by simulating a second human grader.},

abstract = {Digital accessibility ensures that digital products and services are usable by a diverse range of users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. While numerous standards and guidelines have been established to aid developers in creating accessible content, studies reveal a persistent lack of accessibility in many web and mobile applications. This gap is often attributed to barriers such as lack of awareness, insufficient knowledge, absence of specific requirements, time constraints, and lack of executive support. In this context, we aim to address the lack of awareness and knowledge challenges by proposing a hands-on approach that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to enhance students' accessibility awareness, knowledge, and practical skills. We engaged software engineering students in tasks involving website development and accessibility evaluation using checker tools, and we utilized ChatGPT 3.5 to fix identified accessibility issues. Our findings suggest that practical assignments significantly enhance learning outcomes, as interactions with LLMs allow students to develop a deeper understanding of accessibility concepts.

The results indicate that combining practical assignments with AI-driven support effectively improves students' proficiency in web accessibility.},

abstract = {Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into computer science education offers transformative potential for complex courses such as data structures and algorithms (DSA). This study examines ChatGPT as a supplementary tool for teaching assistants (TAs), guided by structured prompts and human oversight, to enhance instruction and student outcomes. A controlled experiment compared traditional TA-led instruction with a hybrid approach where TAs used ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT o1 to generate exercises, clarify concepts, and provide feedback. Structured prompts emphasized problem decomposition, real-world context, and code examples, enabling tailored support while mitigating over-reliance on AI. Results demonstrated the hybrid approach’s efficacy, with students in the ChatGPT-assisted group scoring 16.50 points higher on average and excelling in advanced topics. However, ChatGPT’s limitations necessitated TA verification. This framework highlights the dual role of LLMs: augmenting TA efficiency while ensuring accuracy through human oversight, offering a scalable solution for human-AI collaboration in education.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in large language model-based generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have transformed computer science education, presenting both opportunities and challenges. A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a leap in artificial intelligence, excelling in tasks using human language(s). Although the main focus of general-purpose LLMs is not code generation, they have shown promising results in the domain. However, the usefulness of LLMs in an academic software engineering project has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we explore the usefulness of LLMs for 214 students working in teams consisting of up to six members. Notably, in the academic course through which this study is conducted, students were encouraged to integrate LLMs into their development tool-chain, in contrast to most other academic courses that explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.In this paper, we analyze the AI-generated code, prompts used for code generation, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base. We also conduct a perception study to gain insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLM from a computer science student's perspective. Our findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures, and helping with syntax and error debugging. These insights provide us with a framework on how to effectively utilize LLMs as a tool to enhance the productivity of software engineering students, and highlight the necessity of shifting the educational focus toward preparing students for successful human-AI collaboration.},

These benefits include helping students identify areas for improvement, develop a more accurate assessment of their own abilities, and improve their overall attitudes toward computer science.

The study assesses six different AI-powered code generators. The evaluation focuses on the accuracy of these AI code generators in solving ten programming problems from a set of problems that instructors at Duke University can assign to students for weekly completion. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of coding LLMs in solving these problems.Based on the findings, the paper discusses the challenges faced by the computer science education community and potential strategies to address them. The advent of coding LLMs poses significant challenges to traditional teaching and learning methods in computer science. These challenges include the need for strategies to mitigate any negative impact of LLMs on the learning process. At the same time, these code LLMs also offer tremendous opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning.},

abstract = {In this project, computing students learn to integrate large language models (LLMs) into a software system. Students develop a Java application with a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX, gain practical experience with prompt engineering, and learn about the impact of LLM parameters and conversational roles. Students are provided with a Javabased API that connects with OpenAI's GPT model. The project emphasizes teaching students to manage LLM API calls, enhance GUI responsiveness, and improve the user experience all in the context of an AI-powered application. This experience equips them with critical skills in software development and AI application. It prepares them for advanced software development by learning how to create effective LLM prompts to create intelligent and user-friendly applications. We share the experience of using this project and provide guidelines for assessing it in a second-year software engineering undergraduate course, where students' prior programming experience is limited to the prerequisite CS2 course on object-oriented programming. In the case study we present, the project involved developing a riddle-solving escape room, which we called EscAIpe Room.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are already heavily used by professional software engineers. An important skill for new university graduates to possess will be the ability to use such LLMs to effectively navigate and modify a large code base. While much of the prior work related to LLMs in computing education focuses on novice programmers learning to code, less work has focused on how upper-division students use and trust these tools, especially while working with large code bases. In this study, we taught students about various GitHub Copilot features, including Copilot chat, in an upper-division software engineering course and asked students to add a feature to a large code base using Copilot. Our analysis revealed a novel interaction pattern that we call one-shot prompting, in which students ask Copilot to implement the entire feature at once and spend the next few prompts asking Copilot to debug the code or asking Copilot to regenerate its incorrect response. Finally, students reported significantly more trust in the code comprehension features than code generation features of Copilot, perhaps due to the presence of trust affordances in the Copilot chat that are absent in the code generation features. Our study takes the first steps in understanding how upper-division students use Github Copilot so that our instruction can adequately prepare students for a career in software engineering.},

This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of ChatGPT amongst students.

However, there are concerns about their relevance in modern software engineering since they often miss the developers' notion of readability and rely on outdated code. This research assesses existing Java CR models for LLM adjustments, measuring the correlation between their and developers' evaluations of AI-generated Java code. Using the Repertory Grid Technique with 15 developers, we identified 12 key code aspects influencing CR that were consequently assessed by 390 programmers when labeling 120 AI-generated snippets. Our findings indicate that when AI generates concise and executable code, it's often considered readable by CR models and developers. However, a limited correlation between these evaluations underscores the importance of future research on learning objectives for adjusting LLMs and on the aspects influencing CR evaluations included in predictive models.},

abstract = {Courses in computer science (CS) often assess student programming assignments manually, with the intent of providing in-depth feedback to each student regarding correctness, style, efficiency, and other quality attributes. As class sizes increase, however, it is hard to provide detailed feedback consistently, especially when multiple assessors are required to handle a larger number of assignment submissions. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising alternative to help automate this process in a consistent, scalable, and minimally-biased manner.This paper explores ChatGPT-4's scalablility and accuracy in assessing programming assignments based on predefined rubrics in the context of a case study we conducted in an upper-level undergraduate and graduate CS course at Vanderbilt University. In this case study, we employed a method that compared assessments generated by ChatGPT-4 against human graders to measure the accuracy, precision, and recall associated with identifying programming mistakes. Our results show that when ChatGPT-4 is used properly (e.g., with appropriate prompt engineering and feature selection) it can improve objectivity and grading efficiency, thereby acting as a complementary tool to human graders for advanced computer science graduate and undergraduate students.},

As these models become more sophisticated, particularly in code generation capabilities, educators need to adapt their CS1 courses. In this experience report, we share observations we made while designing and teaching LLM activities for CS1 students at two academic institutions during the spring 2024 term. Drawing on recent research, our activities consist of four short 10-15 minute exercises that guide students in how to properly utilize LLMs within their CS1 coursework. These activities can be easily added to the existing CS1 course curriculum to supplement the existing course materials. Post-activity surveys indicated a positive impact on students' understanding of CS concepts and indicated enthusiasm for learning how to use LLMs safely in programming.},

This talk presents an innovative curriculum approach, integrating AI tools into an advanced CS capstone course at a stage where students possess foundational skills in software engineering. This strategic timing ensures students can critically engage with AI, recognizing biases and managing challenges like hallucinations in AI-generated outputs.Before redesigning the curriculum, independent research was conducted to understand the strengths and limitations of various AI tools, such as Lucidchart, Eraser.io for design documentation, and GitHub Copilot, GPT-4, Codeium, Claude, and Gemini for implementation tasks like code generation, code completion, UI design, error handling, and API integration. This research guided the curriculum by shaping assignment design and delivering foundational lectures on prompt engineering to ease the learning curve for students. Experiments during the capstone course included AI-enhanced assignments and projects, where students applied these tools for software design and implementation. Quantitative data-prompt refinement counts, error rates, code accuracy, and qualitative reflections revealed increased confidence in AI tools, enhanced productivity, and greater readiness for industry roles. Despite these benefits, students faced challenges with complex tasks that required iterative refinement and oversight, but they gained skills in managing biases and hallucinations in AI outputs. The curriculum's ''right-left'' approach enables a smooth transition to AI-assisted development, preparing students for the evolving tech landscape. This talk shares key findings, best practices, and insights into balancing manual skills with AI-enhanced learning.},

This one-hour workshop will help computer science educators respond to this demand by introducing the Python transformers library and its associated LLM ecosystem [1]. We will discuss how LLMs can be integrated into college computer science curricula from CS 1 through advanced courses in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Natural Language Processing. Specific topics include• Using the transformers library with pre-trained models for inference tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, summarization, translation, and question answering in only a few lines of code• Searching for and using hundreds of thousands of different pre-trained language models hosted by Hugging Face along with datasets that they can be tested on• Utilizing conversational models to build chat bots},

This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the capability of large language models in ideating and designing culturally responsive projects for elementary and middle school programming classes. Our ultimate goal is to support K-8 teachers in effectively extracting suggestions from large language models by only using natural language modifications. Furthermore, we aim to develop a comprehensive assessment framework for culturally responsive AI-generated project ideas.

abstract = {Self-reflection on learning experiences constitutes a fundamental cognitive process, essential for consolidating knowledge and enhancing learning efficacy. However, traditional methods to facilitate reflection often face challenges in personalization, immediacy of feedback, engagement, and scalability. Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the reflection process could mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we conducted two randomized field experiments in undergraduate computer science courses to investigate the potential of LLMs to help students engage in post-lesson reflection. In the first experiment (N=145), students completed a take-home assignment with the support of an LLM assistant; half of these students were then provided access to an LLM designed to facilitate self-reflection. The results indicated that the students assigned to LLM-guided reflection reported somewhat increased self-confidence compared to peers in a no-reflection control and a non-significant trend towards higher scores on a later assessment. Thematic analysis of students' interactions with the LLM showed that the LLM often affirmed the student's understanding, expanded on the student's reflection, and prompted additional reflection; these behaviors suggest ways LLM-interaction might facilitate reflection. In the second experiment (N=112), we evaluated the impact of LLM-guided self-reflection against other scalable reflection methods, such as questionnaire-based activities and review of key lecture slides, after assignment. Our findings suggest that the students in the questionnaire and LLM-based reflection groups performed equally well and better than those who were only exposed to lecture slides, according to their scores on a proctored exam two weeks later on the same subject matter. These results underscore the utility of LLM-guided reflection and questionnaire-based activities in improving learning outcomes. Our work highlights that focusing solely on the accuracy of LLMs can overlook their potential to enhance metacognitive skills through practices such as self-reflection. We discuss the implications of our research for the learning-at-scale community, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance learning experiences through personalized, engaging, and scalable reflection practices.},

The present study examines ChatGPT’s ability to generate code solutions at different difficulty levels for introductory programming courses. We conducted an experiment where ChatGPT was tested on 127 randomly selected programming problems provided by Kattis, an automatic software grading tool for computer science programs, often used in higher education. The results showed that ChatGPT independently could solve 19 out of 127 programming tasks generated and assessed by Kattis. Further, ChatGPT was found to be able to generate accurate code solutions for simple problems but encountered difficulties with more complex programming tasks. The results contribute to the ongoing debate on the utility of AI-powered tools in programming education.},

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

Recent research on LLMs has demonstrated their ability to interpret commands in natural language and produce code in a variety of programming languages. However, it is not clear how well LLMs fair in tackling more complex problem set ups, like those typically seen in Algorithms courses in which students are provided natural language descriptions of an ambiguous problem and use what they learn to map the problem to an algorithmic solution. In this paper, we explore use of LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, as tools for assisting students with complex Computer Science curricula, such as algorithmic problem solving. We specifically aim to see if using prompt refinement techniques, LLMs are capable of taking a problem statement in plain English and performing the following tasks: providing both a natural language description and code solution in the Python programming language, producing an analytical argument for the solutions correctness, and finally providing runtime analysis for the produced solution. Our experiments show that GPT-4o is well suited to solving problems like LeetCode 75 that have been seen during training, and prompt-refinement helps with those that have not been seen.},

We allowed students to use the internet and LLMs (such as ChatGPT or Github Copilot) to help with assignments, with guidelines to avoid plagiarism and encourage learning. We then surveyed students to ask about how they used LLMs, whether they saw others cheating, how they generally used internet-based resources on assignments and exams, and their feedback on the policies. We found that students are overwhelmingly using LLMs (and the internet generally) to learn and code "better" rather than cheat. These results are intended to be a starting point to spark discussion on the adoption of new technologies in introductory computer science courses.

abstract = {The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 kickstarted the release of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) applications to the public domain. Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

abstract = {Facing soaring enrollment and disruptive educational technologies, computing education increasingly relies on the contributions of teaching assistants (TAs), hence the critical importance of high-quality TA training. However, the design and implementation of TA training in computer science face substantial barriers, such as the lack of experienced TA trainers and the scarcity of relevant training materials.This experience report describes the design and implementation of a peer-led computer science TA training program that began in 2022 and has since undergone three iterations, inspired by the approach of agile software development. The current program consists of 10 sessions, organized to serve TAs in three respective stages of professional development. The iterations involved updating and enrichment of the syllabus, transitioning from lecture-centered to discussion-centered training, and discussions of emerging topics in computing education such as the use of large language models (LLMs). Participant feedback showed that TAs approved the iterative design of the training, while identifying areas for further improvement. We summarize lessons learned from the iterative process, reflect on the role of peer TA trainers, and discuss plans for future iterations.},

abstract = {In response to the growing need for socially responsible computer scientists and data scientists, our team is developing a comprehensive data science certificate program specifically tailored for non-computing majors, with a focus on data science for social justice. This program aims to broaden participation in data science and create non-traditional pathways for diverse student populations. Each course in the program is designed to be accessible to non-computing majors, equipping them with the skills to analyze and address social justice issues through data science. Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is employed as an instructional strategy promoting active learning, and real datasets related to social justice are utilized for hands-on activities and assignments, enhancing practical learning experiences. The courses are taught in a synchronous hybrid format, across multiple universities, accommodating both live online and in-person students.This tutorial will equip educators with the tools to incorporate data science for social justice in their courses. Attendees will have access to materials developed for these courses, enabling them to integrate similar content into their own curricula. A key focus is on recent challenges and opportunities created by generative AI. The presenters will share their experiences, course materials, and strategies for introducing computer science through a social justice lens. Participants will share ideas and strategies, which will be collated and made available in a shared repository. This initiative aims to enable educators to train future generations in data science while addressing social justice issues.},

One of the courses focused on software engineering with LLMs, while the two other courses were not directly related to LLMs. The chatbot used OpenAI GPT-4 without additional filters or system prompts.  Our results suggest that only a minority of students engage with the chatbot in the courses that do not relate to LLMs. At the same time, unsurprisingly, nearly all students in the LLM-focused course leveraged the chatbot. In all courses, the majority of the chatbot usage came from a few superusers, whereas the majority of the students did not heavily use the chatbot even though it effectively provided free access to OpenAI's GPT-4 model (which would have otherwise required a paid subscription at the time of the study). We observe that in addition to students using the chatbot for course-specific purposes, many use the chatbot for their own purposes.  Overall, our results suggest that the worst fears of educators -- all students overrelying on chatbots -- did not materialize. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for low usage, including the need for more tailored and scaffolded chatbot experiences targeted for specific types of use cases.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study, we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure responsible and effective implementation.},

This study explores the implementation of AI-Lab, a framework designed to guide students in the effective and ethical use of generative AI, in this case ChatGPT, in academic settings without compromising skill development. Conducted during Spring 2024, our use of the intervention targeted over 500 Computer Science and Data Science majors enrolled in their major-specific Data Structures and Algorithms courses. The AI-Lab framework enabled students to develop both conceptual questions and c++ and Python programs by interacting with ChatGPT and iteratively correcting its errors. Focus groups and post-intervention surveys revealed a generally positive experience. Students appreciated the ability to leverage AI for tasks outside their major, recognizing the value of understanding correct solutions through AI-assisted programming. Moreover, the guided use of generative AI by professors alleviated concerns regarding academic dishonesty, fostering a supportive learning environment. Despite these benefits, students expressed awareness of the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on AI, noting the risk of impeding their professional growth. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the practical utility of AI for non-major related tasks. This study highlights the importance of incorporating structured AI training in curricula to balance skill development and ethical AI usage, offering insights for broader applications in higher education.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT released by OpenAI, have attracted significant attention from both industry and academia due to their demonstrated ability to generate high-quality content for various tasks. Despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs, there are growing concerns regarding their potential risks in various fields, such as news, education, and software engineering. Recently, several commercial and open source LLM-generated content detectors have been proposed, which, however, are primarily designed for detecting natural language content without considering the specific characteristics of program code. This article aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel ChatGPT-generated code detector, CodeGPTSensor, based on a contrastive learning framework and a semantic encoder built with UniXcoder. To assess the effectiveness of CodeGPTSensor on differentiating ChatGPT-generated code from human-written code, we first curate a large-scale Human and Machine comparison Corpus (HMCorp), which includes 550k pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-generated code (i.e., 288k Python code pairs and 222k Java code pairs). Based on the HMCorp dataset, our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated code reveals the challenge and opportunity of distinguishing ChatGPT-generated code from human-written code with their representative features. Our experimental results indicate that CodeGPTSensor can effectively identify ChatGPT-generated code, outperforming all selected baselines.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

abstract = {As data science and artificial intelligence continue to impact society, more and more people are learning how to manipulate data with code. To support these learners, program visualization tools automatically generate diagrams to show how code transforms data, in contrast to tools based on large language models (LLMs) that primarily focus on textual explanations. Although program visualization tools are popular among instructors, do novices find these tools usable and useful for data science programs that often manipulate datasets with many rows? To address this, we evaluate a popular, publicly available tool that generates diagrams for Python pandas code through a randomized, in-lab usability study with 17 data science novices. Despite minimal instruction on how to use the tool, novices found that program visualizations increased their confidence in comprehending and debugging code. In addition, even though the tool sometimes produced diagrams with many visual elements, participant performance on the study tasks was not negatively impacted. These findings suggest design guidelines for program visualization tools to help manage cognitive load for data science novices. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that investigates how novices use program visualization tools to understand code that manipulates data tables, and suggests a future where novices can use automatically generated diagrams as a complement to LLM tools for effectively understanding unfamiliar programs in data science.},

In computer science education, teaching students to select appropriate identifiers is a critical task, especially in CS1. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) could assist in teaching this skill. While prior research has explored the use of LLMs in programming education, their precision and consistency in teaching code quality, particularly identifier selection, remains largely unexplored. For this purpose, this study investigated how well different LLMs can detect and report misleading identifiers. In a dataset of 33 code samples, we manually labeled misleading identifiers. On this dataset, we then tested five different LLMs on their ability to detect these misleading identifiers, measuring the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score. Results revealed that the most successful model, GPT-4o, was able to correctly detect most of the manually flagged misleading variable names. However, it also tended to flag issues with variable identifiers in cases where the human evaluators would not, and refined prompting was not able to discourage this behavior.},

To address this issue, we propose a three-model framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate, classify, and correct student responses to programming questions based on the SOLO Taxonomy. The SOLO Taxonomy provides a structured approach for categorizing student understanding into four levels: Pre-structural, Uni-structural, Multi-structural, and Relational. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieved high accuracy in generating and classifying responses for the Relational category, with moderate accuracy in the Uni-structural and Pre-structural categories, but struggled with the Multi-structural category. The model successfully corrected responses to the Relational level. Although further refinement is needed, these findings suggest that LLMs hold significant potential for supporting computer science education by assessing programming knowledge and guiding students toward deeper cognitive engagement.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {Since data science is traditionally an advanced field taught at the college or university level, introducing its concepts to K-12 students can present unique learning challenges. As educational environments increasingly adopt data science curricula for K-12 students, the need for scalable, personalized teaching tools becomes critical. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) in educational environments offers significant potential for scalability and automation, it is important to note that the generated language output may not always be highly suitable for K-12 students. In this paper, we introduce the DSRAG, a novel educational automatic feedback generation framework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cloud-based LLMs to provide automated and personalized feedback for K-12 students engaged in data science education. DSRAG employs Langchain question-answering and RAG systems to manage educational content and generate feedback on the top of GPT-4. We also demonstrate the framework's capability to simplify complex concepts and align its responses to be pedagogically appropriate and understandable for K-12 students.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT. The pace of advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates the use of existing infrastructure to automate the evaluation of LLM performance on computing education tasks. Concept inventories are well suited for evaluation because of their careful design and prior validity evidence. OBJECTIVES. Our research explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework to evaluate computer science (CS) concept inventories. We explore three primary objectives: evaluation of LLM performance on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories; informal expert panel review of items which had variations between LLM and expected student performance; and description of challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation. METHOD. We used the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework to evaluate the SCS1 and BDSI against 10 LLMS with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning: GPT (3.5, 4.0), Claude (1.3, 2.0, 2.1), Llama (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral v0.1 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B. We used psychometric data from prior studies to measure knowledge levels for each LLM run. We then conducted an informal expert review to qualitatively explore how question design, CS content knowledge, and LLM design may explain differences between LLM and expected student performances. FINDINGS. Our quantitative analysis found that most LLM response patterns reflected a below average introductory computing student with the SCS1 and did not fit the psychometric 2PL model for the BDSI. Our qualitative analysis identified that LLMs performed well on code infill questions, but poorly on nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer questions. We also identified several methodological challenges related to item security, translation, the structure when using HELM. IMPLICATIONS. We consider the feasibility of using automated benchmarking as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous investigations to understand the intersection of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. We also consider connections between psychometric approaches and LLM evaluations to inform the design of computing assessments that are more resilient to LLM advancements.},

While there is a growing body of research in computing education on utilizing large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) in generation and engagement with coding exercises, the use of LLMs for generating programming MCQs has not been extensively explored. We analyzed the capability of GPT-4 to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) aligned with specific learning objectives (LOs) from Python programming classes in higher education. Specifically, we developed an LLM-powered (GPT-4) system for generation of MCQs from high-level course context and module-level LOs. We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be well-aligned with the LOs. Our findings can be leveraged by educators wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support MCQ authoring efforts.},

abstract = {The emergence of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT poses unprecedented risks of new types of plagiarism and cheating where students use LLMs to solve exercises for them. Detecting this behavior will be a necessary component in introductory computer science (CS1) courses, and educators should be well-equipped with detection tools when the need arises. However, ChatGPT generates code non-deterministically, and thus, traditional similarity detectors might not suffice to detect AI-created code. In this work, we explore the affordances of Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection task. We used an openly available dataset of student programs for CS1 assignments and had ChatGPT generate code for the same assignments, and then evaluated the performance of both traditional machine learning models and Abstract Syntax Tree-based (AST-based) deep learning models in detecting ChatGPT code from student code submissions. Our results suggest that both traditional machine learning models and AST-based deep learning models are effective in identifying ChatGPT-generated code with accuracy above 90%. Since the deployment of such models requires ML knowledge and resources that are not always accessible to instructors, we also explore the patterns detected by deep learning models that indicate possible ChatGPT code signatures, which instructors could possibly use to detect LLM-based cheating manually. We also explore whether explicitly asking ChatGPT to impersonate a novice programmer affects the code produced. We further discuss the potential applications of our proposed models for enhancing introductory computer science instruction.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, we have witnessed a flourishing activity in the application of deep learning techniques to solve software engineering problems that were poorly addressed in the past, or not addressed at all. In this context, researchers put effort into creating specialized representations and models, hence giving a tangible, conceptual contribution beyond the simple application. With the advent of Large Language Models, such contributions were surpassed, and this was possible because big techs had the availability of data and infrastructure. As such models are pretty good at solving many software engineering problems, where would research in software engineering, and, specifically, in recommender systems go? Will artificial intelligence research kill it? Fortunately, we should not forget that software engineering is about people, and this is where I believe there will be a lot of room for novel research. Software engineering researchers have the knowledge to understand how LLMs fit (or do not fit) in a development context, by properly pondering, for example, human, ethical, and legal factors. Also, software engineering researchers have a strong empirical background to evaluate the effectiveness of such models where state-of-the-art measurements might not suffice.},

First, the students elicited requirements for systems using RE techniques. Then, the students used ChatGPT 3.5 to generate requirements for the same systems. Finally, they compared both sets of requirements based on equivalence, innovation, and relevance. On average, 65.26% of the requirements generated by ChatGPT were considered equivalents to the requirements the students had elicited. However, students reported that ChatGPT generates broad and non-specific requirements. Students also reported that ChatGPT 3.5 can foster the requirements elicitation, but it is necessary to establish well-defined prompts for generating requirements.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently taken many fields, including computer science, by storm. Most recent work on LLMs in computing education has shown that they are capable of solving most introductory programming (CS1) exercises, exam questions, Parsons problems, and several other types of exercises and questions. Some work has investigated the ability of LLMs to solve CS2 problems as well. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs fare against more advanced upper-division coursework, such as proofs in algorithms courses. After all, while known to be proficient in many programming tasks, LLMs have been shown to have more difficulties in forming mathematical proofs.In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to solve mathematical proofs by using Proof Blocks, a tool previously shown to efficaciously teach proofs to students. Our results show that GPT-3.5 is almost completely unable to provide correct solutions (11.4%), while GPT-4 shows a significant increase in correctness (64.8%). However, even given this improvement, current models still struggle to correctly order lines in a proof. It remains an open question whether this is a temporary situation or if LLMs will continue to struggle to solve these types of exercises in the future.},

Second, we explore the methodology for detecting ChatGPT content. We start by examining the unsatisfactory performance of existing ChatGPT detecting tools and the challenges faced by human evaluators (including more than 240 researchers or students). We then test the hand-crafted linguistic features models as a baseline and develop a deep neural framework named CheckGPT to better capture the subtle and deep semantic and linguistic patterns in ChatGPT written literature. Last, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed CheckGPT framework in each benchmarking task over different disciplines. To evaluate the detectability of ChatGPT content, we conduct extensive experiments on the transferability, prompt engineering, and robustness of CheckGPT.},

These introductory AI courses mustn't replicate the "gateway/weed-out" phenomenon observed in introductory computer science courses like CS1 and CS2. Literature in computer science education suggests that interventions such as summer camps, bridge courses, and socio-technical courses have improved the sense of belonging and retention among students from underrepresented groups, thereby broadening participation in computer science. Building on previous work to create a socio-technical curriculum for all ages and education levels, this paper presents a course for teaching introductory AI concepts that adopts a socio-technical approach, complete with weekly activities and content designed for broad access. The course has been taught as a 1-credit general education course, primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors, and a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels.This paper provides a curriculum and resources to teach a socio-technical introductory AI course. This approach is important because it not only democratizes AI education across diverse student backgrounds but also equips all students with the critical socio-technical multidisciplinary perspective necessary to navigate and shape the future ethical landscape of AI technology.},

abstract = {The gender gap in computing persists even after decades of investment in lowering the gap. Evidence suggests that stereotypical attitudes and bias perceptions play a critical role in limiting female participation in STEM, beginning in middle and high school. The gap is exacerbated in developing nations with limited academic counselor support. Therefore, the goal is to provide early targeted counseling. RAFIKI - "friend" in Swahili is a large language model-based web application designed to mimic an academic coach. Using user inputs, it provides customized academic counseling with curated information on STEM and computing pathways. Initial experimental evidence shows that RAFIKI use leads to a significant increase in AP Computer Science A course enrollment, considered a pathway to future computing career, particularly among female high school students.},

abstract = {In Agile software development methodology, a user story describes a new feature or functionality from an end user's perspective. The user story details may also incorporate acceptance testing criteria, which can be developed through negotiation with users. When creating stories from user feedback, the software engineer may maximize their usefulness by considering story attributes, including scope, independence, negotiability, and testability. This study investigates how LLMs (large language models), with guided instructions, affect undergraduate software engineering students' ability to transform user feedback into user stories. Students, working individually, were asked to analyze user feedback comments, appropriately group related items, and create user stories following the principles of INVEST, a framework for assessing user stories. We found that LLMs help students develop valuable stories with well-defined acceptance criteria. However, students tend to perform better without LLMs when creating user stories with an appropriate scope.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to write computer code. This ability can be quite beneficial when integrated into an IDE to assist a programmer with basic coding. On the other hand, it may be misused by computer science students for cheating on coding tests or homework assignments. At present, knowledge about the exact capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs is still inadequate. Furthermore, their capabilities have been changing quickly with each new release. In this paper, we present a dataset of 559 programming exercises in 10 programming languages collected from a system for evaluating coding assignments at our university. We have experimented with four well-known LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Codey, Code Llama) and asked them to solve these assignments. The evaluation results are intriguing and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models. In particular, GPT-4 (which performed the best) is currently capable of solving 55% of all our exercises and achieved an average score of 86% on exercises from the introductory programming course (using the best of five generated solutions).},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

abstract = {Recent studies have showcased the exceptional performance of LLMs (Large Language Models) on assessment questions across various discipline areas. This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks.},

Performing these reviews is time-consuming for teaching assistants and professors to complete, consequently impacting the timeliness and consistency of the provided feedback. When code feedback is not delivered close to the time of authorship, the utility of the review for students is diminished. Prior work with Automatic Static Analysis Tools has shown promise at using artificial intelligence to automate code reviews, with some success integrating them into classroom environments. To leverage new advances in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models, this work reports on an Automatic Review Tool (ART) to provide timely, automatically generated code reviews. ART was evaluated in a second-semester computer science course by integrating ART into the course's Github-based assignment submission system. A cohort of student volunteers (N = 74) read the ART reviews and provided feedback using a survey spanning two of their course assignments. The results of this pilot study show that students perceived ART was successful at detecting defects and offering style-based suggestions, and students were receptive to receiving future automated reviews of their work.},

Gabriel critiques the limitations of large language models (LLMs), noting that they lack the human ability to handle novel situations and discover new information, being constrained to knowledge acquired during training. He suggests that the comprehensive training of LLMs across all perspectives prevents them from developing a unique point of view, which could be detrimental to their creative capabilities. Gabriel provocatively speculates that a more limited, less knowledgeable LLM might better emulate human writers, learning to forget and thereby fostering a more genuine form of creativity.},

abstract = {The Artificial Intelligence Smart Classroom Initiative (ASCI) presents a re-imagined set of online course tools, designed primarily to support growing computer science classes. The system has four primary tools: an office hours queue, an automatic student grouping algorithm, a course-specific local large-language model (LLM), and administration tools for detecting students and TAs that need support. These tools interoperate to improve the quality of one another (e.g., LLM conversations support students directly in the office hours queue) and are enhanced by synchronizing data from multiple external sources such as Piazza, Gradescope, and Canvas. The system has been deployed in multiple courses over the past three semesters: initially as a FIFO queue, then supporting manual grouping and smart grouping of office hour attendees, and recently including LLM support. Preliminary results indicate that students who were grouped using the tool were more likely to return to the queue more than twice as often (on average) than those who were not. However, while grouping in office hours has the potential to decrease student wait times, teaching assistants and students tend to favor one-on-one meetings over group meetings. This might be improved in the future with updates to the software, TA training, and incorporation of other supporting tools (e.g., LLM technology). The other, newer, tools will be more thoroughly evaluated in future semesters.},

Computer Science Education (CSE) emphasizes the need for a scientific and comprehensive assessment method that guides the development of the discipline, with a particular focus on practical contributions. However, traditional assessment systems tend to prioritize the theoretical outcomes. Moreover, data expansion demands significant effort and time from educational professionals, making it challenging to conduct a thorough evaluation of the disciplines. To tackle these issues, we introduce a data-driven, contribution-based disciplinary assessment system. This system takes into account both theoretical and practical contributions to provide a holistic evaluation. Our proposed system employs a contribution-based assessment approach to establish a correct evaluative direction, steering discipline construction to align with societal needs. It also incorporates intelligent algorithms and a Large Language Model (LLM), leveraging their substantial computational power in the evaluation process. This integration alleviates the workload of educational professionals by automating the collection and analysis of information. The paper outlines a detailed implementation plan that integrates contribution evaluation theory with intelligent technologies, aiming to foster the ongoing advancement of CSE education.},

This study investigates the performance of ChatGPT-4 Vision, OpenAI’s most advanced visual model at the time the study was conducted, on the Bachelor in Computer Science section of Brazil’s 2021 National Undergraduate Exam (ENADE). By presenting the model with the exam’s open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model’s reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile. While it excelled in questions that incorporated visual elements, it also encountered challenges with question interpretation, logical reasoning, and visual acuity. A positive correlation between the model’s performance in multiple-choice questions and the performance distribution of the human participants suggests multimodal LLMs can provide a useful tool for question testing and refinement. However, the involvement of an independent expert panel to review cases of disagreement between the model and the answer key revealed some poorly constructed questions containing vague or ambiguous statements, calling attention to the critical need for improved question design in future exams. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4 Vision shows promise in multimodal academic evaluations, human oversight remains crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy and ensuring the fairness of high-stakes educational exams.

abstract = {As AI tools like ChatGPT become more prevalent in educational settings, their potential to assist undergraduate teaching assistants (uTAs) in large Computer Science 2 (CS2) courses presents both opportunities and challenges. This work focuses on how ChatGPT can be strategically utilized by uTAs during office hours to enhance student support, particularly in complex topics such as data structures, algorithm development, and object-oriented programming. We explored effective strategies for uTAs to use ChatGPT in ways that promote deeper student understanding without compromising the development of independent problem-solving skills. Key strategies include leveraging ChatGPT for real-time code debugging assistance, offering alternative approaches to solving coding problems, comparing and critiquing self and AI generated documentation, and code reviewing. This work also identifies potential challenges, such as the risk of students or uTAs becoming overly dependent on AI-generated solutions and the possibility of inaccurate or incomplete responses from the AI. Hence, our findings highlight the dual role of ChatGPT as both an asset and a potential hindrance, depending on how it is utilized. To mitigate these risks, we propose a set of best practices that ensure ChatGPT enhances, rather than replaces, the uTA's role as a facilitator of learning. The findings from this research provide valuable insights into how uTAs can integrate AI tools thoughtfully into office hours to offer more effective support, ultimately improving student engagement and learning outcomes in large-scale CS2 courses.},

Therefore, recommendation frameworks play an important role and their usage is beneficial for a unification of education profiles in a systematic way. This  research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality. The results show that a formalization using GenAI has a high potential, but currently also shows deficits in the correctness of the resulting models, requiring human oversight during the model creation.},

abstract = {The integration of large language models (LLMs) into computing education offers many potential benefits to student learning, and several novel pedagogical approaches have been reported in the literature. However LLMs also present challenges, one of the most commonly cited being that of student over-reliance. This challenge is compounded by the fact that LLMs are always available to provide instant help and solutions to students, which can undermine their ability to independently solve problems and diagnose and resolve errors. Providing instructor oversight of LLM-generated content can mitigate this problem, however it is often not practical in real-time learning contexts. Online class discussion forums, which are widely used in computing education, present an opportunity for exploring instructor oversight because they operate asynchronously. Unlike real-time interactions, the discussion forum format aligns with the expectation that responses may take time, making oversight not only feasible but also pedagogically appropriate. In this practitioner paper, we present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a ‘bot’ module that is controlled by the instructor, and integrated into an online discussion forum. The bot assists the instructor by generating draft responses to student questions, which are reviewed, modified, and approved before release. Key features include the ability to leverage course materials, access archived discussions, and publish responses anonymously to encourage open participation. We report our experiences using this tool in a 12-week second-year software engineering course on object-oriented programming. Instructor feedback confirmed the tool successfully alleviated workload but highlighted a need for improvement in handling complex, context-dependent queries. We report the features that were viewed as most beneficial, and suggest avenues for future exploration.},

abstract = {In higher education, introductory Computer Science (CS) programs offer a range of foundational courses. These encompass not only the standard CS1 and CS2 courses but may also include more specialized options like CS0 and CS1.5. In order to appropriately assign students to the suitable introductory courses, many institutions utilize placement tests, which assess students' pre-existing knowledge and skills. While most institutions rely on accuracy alone to make these determinations, there is often additional information concealed within the completed tests. This paper delves into the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to uncover this hidden information, particularly in gaining insights into how students perform in different concepts. Moreover, our framework has the flexibility to accommodate variations in curricula across different institutions, providing additional analytical perspectives. Initially, we built a concept inventory (CI) using the concepts covered in an institution's CS0, CS1, and CS2 curricula. Next, an LLM, specifically GPT 3.5, was applied to associate each question in the placement test with one or more concepts in the CI. Finally, the results of the placement tests were scrutinized, allowing the calculation of mastery levels in each concept for individual students. These mastery levels enable institutions to gauge a student's prior knowledge across various concepts simply by using a CS placement test. Additionally, we presented a case study demonstrating the application of this framework to 267 existing placement test results at Boston College.},

However, creating scenarios to explore the software (such as test charters) can be time-consuming, and depending on the team’s experience, it may lack adequate coverage of functionalities and scenarios that target specific user profiles of the application. Objective: This article investigates how AI, through LLMs (Large Language Models), can assist in creating exploratory test charters that reflect the characteristics and needs of different user personas. Method: To achieve this, an experimental study was conducted where personas were used as input in ChatGPT 3.5 to generate exploratory test charters. The effectiveness of the approach was evaluated by Software Engineering students, who analyzed the performance and usefulness of the generated charters through a questionnaire based on the TAM model, supplemented by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results: Data analysis indicated positive acceptance of ChatGPT 3.5 by the participants, highlighting its ease of use and perceived usefulness. Conclusion: This study contributes to the field of Software Engineering by demonstrating a practical application of artificial intelligence in the automated generation of test charters. ChatGPT 3.5 has proven to be a promising tool to support the creation of personalized exploratory test charters, contributing to software quality improvement. The integration of artificial intelligence techniques with user-centered design methods can significantly optimize the software testing process.},

abstract = {Software development life cycle is profoundly influenced by bugs; their introduction, identification, and eventual resolution account for a significant portion of software development cost. This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose : a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs.  combines a Retriever – transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator – an LLM (12 billion parameter Codex Cushman model) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via adding bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated , a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that  outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java. We discuss the deployment of  alongside Infer at Microsoft which offers an end-to-end solution for detection, classification, and localization of bugs, as well as fixing and validation of candidate patches, integrated in the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate the software development workflow.},

A move from syntax-focused topics in CS1 toward abstraction and high-level application design seems motivated by the new large language models (LLMs) recently made available. In this position paper however, we advocate for an approach more informed by the AI itself - teaching early CS learners not only how to use the tools but also how to better understand them. Novice programmers leveraging AI-code-generation without proper understanding of syntax or logic can create "black box" code with significant security vulnerabilities. We outline methods for integrating basic AI knowledge and traditional software verification steps into CS1 along with LLMs, which will better prepare students for software development in professional settings.},

abstract = {Evaluating the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with user-defined coding preferences is a challenging endeavor that requires a deep assessment of LLMs’ outputs. Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework and present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset for assessing and improving LLM alignment with coding preferences. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are annotated using GPT-3.5 as a judge, with both ranking-based scores and detailed textual feedback across five distinct coding preferences. Our analysis reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are consistently rated higher than those from open-weight models, underscoring substantial alignment gaps between closed- and open-weight LLMs. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned model achieves an average alignment improvement of 22.7% and 29.7% when evaluated with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 judges, respectively. Notably, our aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct surpasses much larger models, such as CodeLlama-13B and 34B, in alignment with coding preferences. Despite not being explicitly trained for functional correctness, it also achieves a 10.5% and 26.6% relative improvement in Pass@ (1)  and Pass@ (10)  on the HumanEval+ benchmark. Our contributions demonstrate the practical value of preference tuning in code generation and set the stage for further progress in model alignment and RLAIF for automated software engineering.},

Existing research in Computer Science Education has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate coding exercises. However, this has not been demonstrated for SQL yet but could save teachers much time. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to have ChatGPT-3.5 generate database schemas and associated SQL questions for teachers through a two-part study. Through a survey of educators, we found that creating a story and database schema for the SQL part is more time-consuming than the questions themselves. In our prompt engineering study, we identified prompts that were successful at creating database schemas, mock data, and exercises. However, although ChatGPT could help reduce the time required to create exams, some participants indicated that they are skeptical about using LLMs.},

abstract = {Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to fix bugs by generating patches. And existing work has demonstrated that "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm enables Large Language Models (LLMs) improve fixing capabilities on APR. However, existing work mainly focuses on Full-Model Fine-Tuning (FMFT) for APR and limited research has been conducted on the execution-based evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for APR. Comparing to FMFT, PEFT can reduce computing resource consumption without compromising performance and has been widely adopted to other software engineering tasks.To fill this gap, we enhance the existing APR dataset by employing prompt engineering to create an instruction dataset, APR-Instruction, at first. Secondly, we fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs using four different PEFT methods with APR-Instruction. The best fine-tuned model fixes 58% more bugs than the state-of-the-art LLM-based APR techniques. The results also show that (IA)3 improves the creativity of LLMs more effectively through fine-tuning and achieves the highest fixing capability compared to the other three PEFT methods. Thirdly, we explore the optimal configuration of PEFT hyperparameters, and assess the impact of instruction dataset size, showing that a larger number of parameters and a larger training dataset do not necessarily result in better performance for PEFT. Lastly, we analyze peak memory usage and trainable parameters to show the efficiency of PEFT.This work provides a comprehensive exploration of PEFT on APR and suggests potentially promising directions for extension to other software engineering downstream tasks. APR-Instruction, PEFT weights, and the fine-tuning code are publicly available as open-source resources.},

abstract = {In the evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) tailored for software engineering, the need for benchmarks that accurately reflect real-world development scenarios is paramount. Current benchmarks are either too simplistic or fail to capture the multi-tasking nature of software development. To address this, we introduce CoderUJB, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across diverse Java programming tasks that are executable and reflective of actual development scenarios, acknowledging Java's prevalence in real-world software production. CoderUJB comprises 2,239 programming questions derived from 17 real open-source Java projects and spans five practical programming tasks. Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the coding abilities of various open-source and closed-source LLMs, examining the effects of continued pre-training in specific programming languages code and instruction fine-tuning on their performance. The findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit strong potential, challenges remain, particularly in non-functional code generation (e.g., test generation and defect detection). Importantly, our results advise caution in the specific programming languages continued pre-training and instruction fine-tuning, as these techniques could hinder model performance on certain tasks, suggesting the need for more nuanced strategies. CoderUJB thus marks a significant step towards more realistic evaluations of programming capabilities in LLMs, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these models in software engineering.},

abstract = {The recent, widespread availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot may impact introductory programming courses (CS1) both in terms of what should be taught and how to teach it. Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of software engineering and coding tasks. However, their application in the domain of code and compiler optimization remains underexplored. Training LLMs is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU hours and extensive data collection, which can be prohibitive. To address this gap, we introduce LLM&nbsp;Compiler, a suite of robust, openly available, pre-trained models specifically designed for compiler tasks. Built on the foundation of Code&nbsp;Llama, LLM&nbsp;Compiler enhances the understanding of compiler intermediate representations (IRs), assembly language, and optimization techniques. The models have been trained on a vast corpus of 546 billion tokens of LLVM-IR and assembly code and have undergone instruction fine-tuning to interpret compiler behavior.    To demonstrate the utility of these research tools, we also present fine-tuned versions of the models with enhanced capabilities in optimizing code size and disassembling from x86_64 and ARM assembly back into LLVM-IR. These achieve 77% of the optimising potential of an autotuning search, and 45% disassembly round trip (14% exact match).    LLM&nbsp;Compiler is released under a bespoke commercial license to allow wide reuse and is available in two sizes: 7 billion and 13 billion parameters. Our aim is to provide scalable, cost-effective foundational models for further research and development in compiler optimization by both academic researchers and industry practitioners. Since we released LLM&nbsp;Compiler the community has quantized, repackaged, and downloaded the models over 250k times.},

abstract = {Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective ➊), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective ➋). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches.We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.},

abstract = {Natural language processing has taken enormous steps during the last few years. The development of large language models and generative AI has elevated natural language processing to the level that it can output coherent and contextually relevant text for a given natural language prompt. ChatGPT is one incarnation of these steps, and its use in education is a rather new phenomenon. In this paper, we study students’ perception on ChatGPT during a computer science course. On the course, we integrated ChatGPT into Teams private discussion groups. In addition, all the students had freedom to employ ChatGPT and related technologies to help them in their coursework. The results show that the majority of students had at least tested AI-powered chatbots, and that students are using AI-powered chatbots for multiple tasks, e.g., debugging code, tutoring, and enhancing comprehension. The amount of positive implications of using ChatGPT takes over the negative implications, when the implications were considered from an understanding, learning and creativity perspective. Relatively many students reported reliability issues with the outputs and that the iterations with prompts might be necessary for satisfactory outputs. It is important to try to steer the usage of ChatGPT so that it complements students’ learning processes, but does not replace it.},

abstract = {Researchers have made significant progress in automating the software development process in the past decades. Automated techniques for issue summarization, bug reproduction, fault localization, and program repair have been built to ease the workload of developers. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the development process, where developers can use LLM-based programming assistants to achieve automated coding. Nevertheless, software engineering involves the process of program improvement apart from coding, specifically to enable software maintenance (e.g. program repair to fix bugs) and software evolution (e.g. feature additions). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for solving Github issues to autonomously achieve program improvement. In our approach called AutoCodeRover, LLMs are combined with sophisticated code search capabilities, ultimately leading to a program modification or patch. In contrast to recent LLM agent approaches from AI researchers and practitioners, our outlook is more software engineering oriented. We work on a program representation (abstract syntax tree) as opposed to viewing a software project as a mere collection of files. Our code search exploits the program structure in the form of classes/methods to enhance LLM’s understanding of the issue’s root cause, and effectively retrieve a context via iterative search. The use of spectrum-based fault localization using tests, further sharpens the context, as long as a test-suite is available. Experiments on the recently proposed SWE-bench-lite (300 real-life Github issues) show increased efficacy in solving Github issues (19% on SWE-bench-lite), which is higher than the efficacy of the recently reported Swe-agent. Interestingly, our approach resolved 57 GitHub issues in about 4 minutes each (pass@1), whereas developers spent more than 2.68 days on average. In addition, AutoCodeRover achieved this efficacy with significantly lower cost (on average, $0.43 USD), compared to other baselines. We posit that our workflow enables autonomous software engineering, where, in future, auto-generated code from LLMs can be autonomously improved.},

abstract = {Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student’s code submission passes each test case and 2) the student’s open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.},

abstract = {Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, has garnered attention in computer science education. This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey.With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.},

Recently, tools that leverage LLMs have made their way into the classroom where they help students generate code and help instructors generate learning materials. There are likely many more uses of these tools -- both beneficial to learning and possibly detrimental to learning. To help ensure that these tools are used to enhance learning, educators need to not only be familiar with these tools, but with their use and potential misuse. The goal of this BoF is to raise awareness about LLMs and to build a learning community around their use in computing education. Aligned with this goal of building an inclusive learning community, our BoF is led by globally distributed discussion leaders, including undergraduate researchers, to facilitate multiple coordinated discussions that can lead to a broader conversation about the role of LLMs in CS education.},

Quantifying the improvement over the original archived by the improve code in a verifiable and measurable way. In so doing, the Assured LLMSE approach tackles the problem of LLMs’ tendency to hallucinate, as well as providing confidence that generated code improves an existing code base. Software testing and measurement play critical roles in this improvement process: testing is the guard against regression, while measurement provides the quantifiable assurance of improvement. Assured LLMSE takes its inspiration from previous work on genetic improvement, for which software measurement also plays a central role. In this keynote we outline the Assured LLMSE approach, highlighting the role of software measurement in the provision of quantifiable, verifiable assurances for code that originates from LLM–based inference.

abstract = {Learning to program requires the development of a variety of skills including the ability to read, comprehend, and communicate the purpose of code. In the age of large language models (LLMs), where code can be generated automatically, developing these skills is more important than ever for novice programmers. The ability to write precise natural language descriptions of desired behavior is essential for eliciting code from an LLM, and the code that is generated must be understood in order to evaluate its correctness and suitability. In introductory computer science courses, a common question type used to develop and assess code comprehension skill is the 'Explain in Plain English' (EiPE) question. In these questions, students are shown a segment of code and asked to provide a natural language description of that code's purpose. The adoption of EiPE questions at scale has been hindered by: 1) the difficulty of automatically grading short answer responses and 2) the ability to provide effective and transparent feedback to students. To address these shortcomings, we explore and evaluate a grading approach where a student's EiPE response is used to generate code via an LLM, and that code is evaluated against test cases to determine if the description of the code was accurate. This provides a scalable approach to creating code comprehension questions and enables feedback both through the code generated from a student's description and the results of test cases run on that code. We evaluate students' success in completing these tasks, their use of the feedback provided by the system, and their perceptions of the activity.},

abstract = {Programming skills are typically developed through completing various hands-on exercises. Such programming problems can be contextualized to students’ interests and cultural backgrounds. Prior research in educational psychology has demonstrated that context personalization of exercises stimulates learners’ situational interests and positively affects their engagement. However, creating a varied and comprehensive set of programming exercises for students to practice on is a time-consuming and laborious task for computer science educators. Previous studies have shown that large language models can generate conceptually and contextually relevant programming exercises. Thus, they offer a possibility to automatically produce personalized programming problems to fit students’ interests and needs. This article reports on a user study conducted in an elective introductory programming course that included contextually personalized programming exercises created with GPT-4. The quality of the exercises was evaluated by both the students and the authors. Additionally, this work investigated student attitudes towards the created exercises and their engagement with the system. The results demonstrate that the quality of exercises generated with GPT-4 was generally high. What is more, the course participants found them engaging and useful. This suggests that AI-generated programming problems can be a worthwhile addition to introductory programming courses, as they provide students with a practically unlimited pool of practice material tailored to their personal interests and educational needs.},

In this paper, our goal is to explore conversations between developers and ChatGPT related to refactoring to better understand how developers identify areas for improvement in code and how ChatGPT addresses developers' needs. Our approach relies on text mining refactoring-related conversations from 17,913 ChatGPT prompts and responses, and investigating developers' explicit refactoring intention. Our results reveal that (1) developer-ChatGPT conversations commonly involve generic and specific terms/phrases; (2) developers often make generic refactoring requests, while ChatGPT typically includes the refactoring intention; and (3) various learning settings when prompting ChatGPT in the context of refactoring. We envision that our findings contribute to a broader understanding of the collaboration between developers and AI models.},

abstract = {With the proven effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-related tasks, researchers have explored their potential for program repair. However, existing repair benchmarks might have influenced LLM training data, potentially causing data leakage. To evaluate LLMs’ realistic repair capabilities, (i) we introduce an extensive, non-crawled benchmark TutorCode, comprising 1,239 C++ defect codes and associated information such as tutor guidance, solution description, failing test cases, and the corrected code. Our work assesses LLM’s repair performance on TutorCode, measuring repair correctness (TOP-5 and AVG-5) and patch precision (RPSR). (ii) We then provide a comprehensive investigation into which types of extra information can help LLMs improve their repair performance. Among these types, tutor guidance was the most effective information. To fully harness LLMs’ conversational capabilities and the benefits of augmented information, (iii) we introduce a novel conversational semi-automatic repair framework CREF assisting human programming tutors. It demonstrates a remarkable AVG-5 improvement of 17.2%-24.6% compared to the baseline, achieving an impressive AVG-5 of 76.6% when utilizing GPT-4. These results highlight the potential for enhancing LLMs’ repair capabilities through tutor interactions and historical conversations. The successful application of CREF in a real-world educational setting demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing tutors’ workload and improving students’ learning experience, showing promise for code review and other software engineering tasks.},

abstract = {This work investigates the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the COVID-19 pandemic on student behavior with autograder systems in three programming-heavy courses. We examine whether the release of LLMs like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, along with post-pandemic effects, has modified student interactions with autograders. Using data from student submissions over five years, totalling over 4,500 students across over 420,000 submissions, we analyze trends in submission behaviors before and after these events. Our methodology involves tracking submission patterns, focusing on timing, frequency, and score.Contrary to expectations, our findings reveal that metrics remain relatively consistent in the post-ChatGPT and post-pandemic era. Despite yearly fluctuations, no significant shift in student behaviors is attributable to these changes. Students continue to rely on a combination of manual debugging and autograder feedback without noticeable changes in their problem-solving approach.These findings highlight the resilience of the educational practices in these courses and suggest that integrating LLMs into mid-level CS curriculum may not necessitate the significant paradigm shift previously envisioned. Future work should extend these analyses to courses with different structures to determine if these results are generalizable. If not, the specific course aspects contributing to our observed ChatGPT and pandemic resilience should be identified.},

abstract = {Software Engineering (SE) researchers are extensively applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenges in SE tasks such as code clone detection, code summarization, and program comprehension. Despite promising results, LLMs have to be fine-tuned and customized with specific datasets for optimal performance. However, the proprietary nature of SE data, and the lack of LLMs trained on non-open source data is an open problem. While there exists work on applying Federated Learning (FL) for SE, integration of FL with LLMs for SE is unexplored. Hence, we propose a FedLLM for “code summarization” as developers spend more time in comprehending code. We setup a federated learning architecture and fine-tune LLM (Llama2 with 6.7B parameters) using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for code summarization. We conducted our experiments on 40GB RAM GPU in an A100 architecture. Results show that FL-trained LLM is as effective as a centrally-trained one. We envision that leveraging non-open source data using FedLLM for SE could be an interesting research direction.},

abstract = {With the advent of large language models (LLMs) in the AI area, the field of software engineering (SE) has also witnessed a paradigm shift. These models, by leveraging the power of deep learning and massive amounts of data, have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to understand, generate, and operate programming languages. They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts. Integrating LLMs within the SE landscape (LLM4SE) has become a burgeoning trend, necessitating exploring this emergent landscape’s challenges and opportunities.The article aims at revisiting the software development lifecycle (SDLC) under LLMs, and highlighting challenges and opportunities of the new paradigm. The article first summarizes the overall process of LLM4SE, and then elaborates on the current challenges based on a through discussion. The discussion was held among more than 20 participants from academia and industry, specializing in fields such as SE and artificial intelligence. Specifically, we achieve 26 key challenges from seven aspects, including software requirement and design, coding assistance, testing code generation, code review, code maintenance, software vulnerability management, and data, training, and evaluation. We hope the achieved challenges would benefit future research in the LLM4SE field.},

abstract = {Very large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several natural-language tasks, and show great promise also for code. A particularly exciting aspect of LLMs is their knack for few-shot and zero-shot learning: they can learn to perform a task with very few examples. Few-shotting has particular synergies in software engineering, where there are a lot of phenomena (identifier names, APIs, terminology, coding patterns) that are known to be highly project-specific. However, project-specific data can be quite limited, especially early in the history of a project; thus the few-shot learning capacity of LLMs might be very relevant. In this paper, we investigate the use few-shot training with the very large GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Codex model, and find evidence suggesting that one can significantly surpass state-of-the-art models for code-summarization, leveraging project-specific training.},

In four different tech events, several example scenarios of how a tech-savvy engineer could use ChatGPT to prototype apps in unfamiliar programming languages were demonstrated, including a health education app. The four events include an IEEE chapter workshop, an IEEE WIE (Woman In Engineering) meeting, an IEEE joint chapter talk, and a university-level Computer Science class. The responses from the tech audience showed that the majority perceived value in the use of LLM chatbots in these contexts, even though there were subtle differences among different groups. This shows the need for further research on how to effectively incorporate LLM chatbots into traditional software design workflow to better serve the software development community.},

abstract = {ChatGPT is the front end to a powerful large language model that has garnered widespread attention in many fields of study, including computer science (CS), where it promises to be transformational. As educators, we are just starting to grapple with the ramifications of this new technology, including implications for what we teach, how we teach, and how we grade. The decisions educators make moving forward depend heavily on the prevalence of students' use (and misuse) of ChatGPT in the classroom. Further, predictors of nefarious use could aid educators as well. We conducted an online survey to capture CS student awareness of, experience with, and attitudes toward ChatGPT. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that awareness of ChatGPT is generally high, and it is more frequently being used as a study tool than to complete students' work for them. Most students are aware of the potential for abuse in academic pursuits, but a notable minority of students admit to using it unscrupulously and to the potential for it to interfere with their learning. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider as educators modify their approaches and develop guidelines for ChatGPT usage in their classrooms.},

Both human and automated assessment identified implausible distractors as one of the most frequent flaw categories.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities to generate accurate code snippets given natural language intents in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without the need for specific fine-tuning. While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios.},

In addition to traditional evaluation metrics, we introduce a custom metric that emphasizes the overlap of key terms and semantic similarity, providing a more comprehensive assessment of our model's performance.

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to solve tasks across various domains, including software engineering. However, their extensive number of parameters makes full fine-tuning computationally prohibitive. While Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as adapter fine-tuning, have been proposed to address this issue; yet, they typically employ default configurations that use the same adapter settings across all layers. Concurrently, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has demonstrated success in hyperparameter optimization, while Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has proven effective in optimizing neural network architectures. Building on these successes, we introduce AutoAdapt, a novel approach that leverages NAS to automatically discover task-specific, layer-wide adapter configurations, allowing each layer to adopt distinct adapter parameters. AutoAdapt defines a search space tailored for adapter-based fine-tuning and employs an evolutionary algorithm to explore a diverse range of configurations, thereby evaluating the benefits of customizing each layer individually. We evaluate AutoAdapt on well-established software engineering tasks, including vulnerability detection, code clone detection, and code search. Our empirical results demonstrate that AutoAdapt outperforms manually engineered adapter configurations, achieving up to a 5% improvement in F1-score for clone detection and defect detection, and up to a 25% improvement in MRR for code search. Additionally, it surpasses other PEFT techniques, such as Prefix Tuning and LoRA. Furthermore, AutoAdapt is capable of identifying configurations that outperform even full fine-tuning, while training less than 2.5% of the model parameters. A comprehensive analysis reveals that factors such as selective layer adaptation, module selection (e.g., attention versus feed-forward layers), normalization, and dropout significantly influence performance across different tasks. Additionally, our findings suggest the possibility of transferring adapter configurations to similar datasets and tasks, thus simplifying the search for optimal PEFT settings.

Concurrently, projects are becoming more complex and are exposed to a greater number of threats. This presents a significant challenge for software engineers. As a result, security and privacy are often neglected due to a lack of knowledge, limited time, and financial constraints. While systematic literature reviews exist to address the increasing volume of publications, software engineers still require up-to-date knowledge of current threats and measures. This paper presents an automated, time-efficient, and cost-effective method for discovering knowledge from state-of-the-art literature and project artifacts, such as design documents. The presented method utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for data extraction and is demonstrated through a prototypical implementation and evaluation. This evaluation involves security and privacy in open-access scientific publications and project documentation from European Union research and development projects. The extracted knowledge is used to populate a quality model that is specifically designed to provide software engineers with information that helps them apply the findings. This quality model offers software engineers valuable, up-to-date insights into security and privacy, bridging the gap between scientific research and practical applications.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineers' daily practices, it is important to ensure that the code generated by these tools is not only functionally correct but also free of vulnerabilities. Although LLMs can help developers to be more productive, prior empirical studies have shown that LLMs can generate insecure code. There are two contributing factors to the insecure code generation. First, existing datasets used to evaluate LLMs do not adequately represent genuine software engineering tasks sensitive to security. Instead, they are often based on competitive programming challenges or classroom-type coding tasks. In real-world applications, the code produced is integrated into larger codebases, introducing potential security risks. Second, existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on the functional correctness of the generated code while ignoring security considerations. Therefore, in this paper, we described Sallm, a framework to benchmark LLMs' abilities to generate secure code systematically. This framework has three major components: a novel dataset of security-centric Python prompts, configurable assessment techniques to evaluate the generated code, and novel metrics to evaluate the models' performance from the perspective of secure code generation.},

abstract = {Software development support tools have been studied for a long time, with recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. These models can generate Python code for data science and machine learning applications. LLMs are helpful for software engineers because they increase productivity in daily work. An LLM can also serve as a "mentor" for inexperienced software developers, and be a viable learning support. High-quality code generation with LLMs can also be beneficial in geospatial data science. However, this domain poses different challenges, and code generation LLMs are typically not evaluated on geospatial tasks. Here, we show how we constructed an evaluation benchmark for code generation models, based on a selection of geospatial tasks. We categorised geospatial tasks based on their complexity and required tools. Then, we created a dataset with tasks that test model capabilities in spatial reasoning, spatial data processing, and geospatial tools usage. The dataset consists of specific coding problems that were manually created for high quality. For every problem, we proposed a set of test scenarios that make it possible to automatically check the generated code for correctness. In addition, we tested a selection of existing code generation LLMs for code generation in the geospatial domain. We share our dataset and reproducible evaluation code on a public GitHub repository1, arguing that this can serve as an evaluation benchmark for new LLMs in the future. Our dataset will hopefully contribute to the development new models capable of solving geospatial coding tasks with high accuracy. These models will enable the creation of coding assistants tailored for geospatial applications.},

Currently, discussions center around potential threats emerging from student's use of ChatGPT. For instance, generative AI will limit the usefulness of graded homework dramatically. However, there exist potential opportunities as well. For example, ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human language allows providing personalized feedback to students, and can thus accompany current software engineering education approaches. This paper highlights the potential for enhancing software engineering education. The availability of generative AI will improve the individualization of education approaches. In addition, we discuss the need to adapt software engineering curricula to the changed profiles of software engineers. Moreover, we point out why it is important to provide guidance for using generative AI and, thus, integrate it in courses rather than accepting the unsupervised use by students, which can negatively impact the students' learning.},

abstract = {Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.},

abstract = {The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant debate, highlighting both their potential to augment student learning and the risks associated with their misuse. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, primarily focusing on evaluating the performance of existing models or conducting short-term human subject studies. However, very little work has examined the impacts of LLM-powered assistants on students in entry-level programming courses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To address this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study with 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our research team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the "CodeTutor group" as the experimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their final scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the "control group"). Within the CodeTutor group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered tools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their counterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding CodeTutor's capability to comprehend their queries and assist in learning programming language syntax. However, they had concerns about CodeTutor's limited role in developing critical thinking skills. Over the course of the semester, students' agreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for support from traditional human teaching assistants. Our findings also show that students turned to CodeTutor for different tasks, including programming task completion, syntax comprehension, and debugging, particularly seeking help for programming assignments. Our analysis further reveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with CodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon these results, we discuss the implications of our findings for the need to integrate Generative AI literacy into curricula to foster critical thinking skills, and turn to examining the temporal dynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the discrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual capabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve educational outcomes.},

abstract = {ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform that can produce code to solve problems when provided with a natural language prompt. Prior work on similar AI models has shown that they perform well on typical intro-level Computer Science problems. However, little is known about the performance of such tools on Data Science (DS) problems. In this work, we assess the performance of ChatGPT on assignments from three DS courses with varying difficulty levels. First, we apply the raw assignment prompts provided to the students and find that ChatGPT performs well on assignments with dataset(s) descriptions and progressive question prompts, which divide the programming requirements into sub-problems. Then, we perform prompt engineering on the assignments for which ChatGPT had low performance. We find that the following prompt engineering techniques significantly increased ChatGPT's performance: breaking down abstract questions into steps, breaking down steps into multiple prompts, providing descriptions of the dataset(s), including algorithmic details, adding specific instructions to entice specific actions, and removing extraneous information. Finally, we discuss how our findings suggest potential changes to curriculum design of DS courses.},

This paper explores the adoption and utilization of generative AI tools among computer science students at the University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna in Austria through a comprehensive survey. The study aims to understand the extent to which AI tools like ChatGPT are integrated into students' academic routines, their perceptions of these tools, and the challenges and opportunities they present. The survey results indicate a high level of acceptance and frequent use of AI tools for tasks such as programming, exam preparation, and generating simplified explanations. However, concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated content and the potential impact on critical thinking skills were also highlighted.

abstract = {A proper code evaluation metric (CEM) profoundly impacts the evolution of code generation, which is an important research field in NLP and software engineering. Prevailing match-based CEMs (e.g., BLEU, Accuracy, and CodeBLEU) suffer from two significant drawbacks. 1. They primarily measure the surface differences between codes without considering their functional equivalence. However, functional equivalence is pivotal in evaluating the effectiveness of code generation, as different codes can perform identical operations. 2. They are predominantly designed for the Ref-only input format. However, code evaluation necessitates versatility in input formats. Aside from Ref-only, there are NL-only and Ref and NL formats, which existing match-based CEMs cannot effectively accommodate. In this article, we propose CodeScore, a large language model (LLM)-based CEM, which estimates the functional correctness of generated code on three input types. To acquire CodeScore, we present UniCE, a unified code generation learning framework, for LLMs to learn code execution (i.e., learning PassRatio and Executability of generated code) with unified input. Extensive experimental results on multiple code evaluation datasets demonstrate that CodeScore absolutely improves up to 58.87% correlation with functional correctness compared to other CEMs, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and effectively handles three input formats.},

A case study analyzed keystroke-level data from an introductory programming course, processed into code snapshots. Three state-of-the-art LLMs – Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4 Turbo, and LLaMa2 70B Chat – were evaluated for their feedback capabilities. Results show LLMs effectively provide tailored feedback, emphasizing incremental development, algorithmic planning, and code readability. Our findings highlight the potential of combining keystroke data with LLMs to automate formative feedback, showing that the computing education research and practice community is again one step closer to automating formative programming process feedback.},

Early IR systems relied on the independence assumptions about words and documents for simplicity and scalability, which were clearly sub-optimal from a semantic point of view. The rapid development of deep neural networks in the past decade has revolutionized the representation learning technologies for contextualized word embedding and graph-enhanced document embedding, leading to the new era of dense IR. This talk highlights such impactful shifts in representation learning for IR and related areas, the new challenges coming along and the remedies, including our recent work in large-scale dense IR [1, 9], in graph-based reasoning for knowledge-enhanced predictions [10], in self-refinement of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG)[2,7] and iterative feedback [3,4], in principle-driven self-alignment of LLMs with minimum human supervision [6], etc. More generally, the power of such deep learning goes beyond IR enhancements, e.g., for significantly improving the state-of-the-art solvers for NP-Complete problems in classical computer science [5,8].},

In the pre-GPT era, we successfully applied oral and open-book home exams for two courses in the third year of our predominantly remote Software Engineering BSc program. We ask in this paper whether our current open-book exams are still viable or whether a move back to a legally compliant but less scalable oral exam is the only workable alternative. We further compare work-effort estimates between oral and open-book exams and report on differences in throughput and grade distribution over eight years to better understand the impact of examination format on the outcome. Examining GPT-4 on the most recent open-book exams showed that our current Artificial Intelligence and Reactive Programming exams are not GPT v4 proof. Three potential weaknesses of GPT are outlined. We also found that grade distributions have largely been unaffected by the examination format, opening up for a move to oral examinations only if needed. Throughput was higher for open-book exam course instances (73% vs 64%), while fail rates were too (12% vs 7%), with teacher workload increasing even for smaller classes. We also report on our experience regarding effort. Oral examinations are efficient for smaller groups but come with caveats regarding intensity and stress.},

abstract = {There is a great need for data in computing education research. Data is needed to understand how students behave, to train models of student behavior to optimally support students, and to develop and validate new assessment tools and learning analytics techniques. However, relatively few computing education datasets are shared openly, often due to privacy regulations and issues in making sure the data is anonymous. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to create large-scale, privacy-preserving synthetic data, which can be used to explore various aspects of student learning, develop and test educational technologies, and support research in areas where collecting real student data may be challenging or impractical. This work explores generating synthetic buggy code submissions for introductory programming exercises using GPT-4o. We compare the distribution of test case failures between synthetic and real student data from two courses to analyze the accuracy of the synthetic data in mimicking real student data. Our findings suggest that LLMs can be used to generate synthetic incorrect submissions that are not significantly different from real student data with regard to test case failure distributions. Our research contributes to the development of reliable synthetic datasets for computing education research and teaching, potentially accelerating progress in the field while preserving student privacy.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLM) have rapidly affirmed in the latest years as a means to support or substitute human actors in a variety of tasks. LLM agents can generate valid software models, because of their inherent ability in evaluating textual requirements provided to them in the form of prompts. The goal of this work is to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to correctly generate UML class diagrams in activities of Requirements Modeling in the field of Software Engineering. Our aim is to evaluate LLMs in an educational setting, i.e., understanding how valuable are the results of LLMs when compared to results made by human actors, and how valuable can LLM be to generate sample solutions to provide to students. For that purpose, we collected 20 exercises from a diverse set of web sources and compared the models generated by a human and an LLM solver in terms of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic correctness, and distance from a provided reference solution. Our results show that the solutions generated by an LLM solver typically present a significantly higher number of errors in terms of semantic quality and textual difference against the provided reference solution, while no significant difference is found in syntactic and pragmatic quality. We can therefore conclude that, with a limited amount of errors mostly related to the textual content of the solution, UML diagrams generated by LLM agents have the same level of understandability as those generated by humans, and exhibit the same frequency in violating rules of UML Class Diagrams.},

abstract = {Open-source software is crucial to modern development, but its complexity creates challenges in quality, security, and management. Current governance approaches excel at collaboration but struggle with decentralized management and security. With the rise of large language models (LLM)-based software engineering, the need for a finer-grained understanding of software composition is more urgent than ever. To address these challenges, inspired by the Human Genome Project, we treat the software source code as software DNA and propose the Software Genome Project (SGP), which is geared towards the secure monitoring and exploitation of open-source software. By identifying and labeling integrated and classified code features at a fine-grained level, and effectively identifying safeguards for functional implementations and nonfunctional requirements at different levels of granularity, the SGP could build a comprehensive set of software genome maps to help developers and managers gain a deeper understanding of software complexity and diversity. By dissecting and summarizing functional and undesirable genes, SGP could help facilitate targeted software optimization, provide valuable insight and understanding of the entire software ecosystem, and support critical development tasks such as open source governance. SGP could also serve as a comprehensive dataset with abundant semantic labeling to enhance the training of LLMs for code. Based on these, we expect SGP to drive the evolution of software development towards more efficient, reliable, and sustainable software solutions.},

abstract = {In the United States, culturally relevant computing (CRC) is one of the most popular pedagogical implementations for Latin American (Latine) students. Culturally-relevant learning resources are a valuable tool for implementing CRC. However, the traditional method of creation and maintenance of textbooks takes a significant amount of time and effort. Given the duration required for textbook production, the development of culturally-relevant learning resources may become lengthened, as it requires close attention both on the material and the incorporation of cultural referents. In order to accelerate the process, we used the advancement of large language models (LLMs) to our advantage. Through prompt engineering, we created a series of prompts to produce a textbook for an introductory computer science course (CS1) that incorporates Latine culture. This textbook was evaluated on metrics regarding sensibility, correctness, readability, linguistic approachability, appropriateness of examples, and cultural relevance. Overall, the generated textbook was mainly sensible, correct, readable, and linguistically approachable. Code examples were not always appropriate due to the usage of libraries that are not typically used in a CS1 course. The cultural relevance was apparent, but it often included surface-level cultural referents. The main incorporation of culture was through geographical locations and people's names. This suggests that the use of LLMs to generate textbooks may serve as a valuable first step for writing culturally-relevant learning resources. Though this study focuses on Latines, our results and prompts may be applicable for generating culturally-relevant CS1 textbooks for other cultures.},

abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) is the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence. It aims to enable computers to understand and generate human natural language. With the development of the Internet and big data, natural language processing has become one of the most popular areas in the AI ​​era. Currently, the rise of large-scale pre-trained language models has greatly promoted progress in this field, making the application of natural language processing more extensive and in-depth. This article first reviews the development history of natural language processing, from early rule-based systems to current deep learning-based models. In particular, the proposal of the Transformer architecture marks a major breakthrough in natural language processing technology. It greatly improves the ability to handle long-distance dependencies through the attention mechanism, and has become the basic model for many NLP tasks. Further, this article explores the significant improvements in performance of large-scale pre-trained models such as GPT and BERT, and how they understand and generate language by learning the subtle laws of language on large amounts of text data. Finally, the perspective is returned to large language models, including the development history, performance and challenges of large models, and the introduction of meditation is proposed to solve the problem of model illusion.},

abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) started a serious discussion among educators on how LLMs would affect, e.g., curricula, assessments, and students' competencies. Generative AI and LLMs also raised ethical questions and concerns for computing educators and professionals.This experience report presents an assignment within a course on professional competencies, including some related to ethics, that computing master's students need in their careers. For the assignment, student groups discussed the ethical process by Lennerfors et al. by analyzing a case: a fictional researcher considers whether to attend the real CHI 2024 conference in Hawaii. The tasks were (1) to participate in in-class discussions on the case, (2) to use an LLM of their choice as a discussion partner for said case, and (3) to document both discussions, reflecting on their use of the LLM.Students reported positive experiences with the LLM as a way to increase their knowledge and understanding, although some identified limitations. The LLM provided a wider set of options for action in the studied case, including unfeasible ones. The LLM would not select a course of action, so students had to choose themselves, which they saw as coherent.From the educators' perspective, there is a need for more instruction for students using LLMs: some students did not perceive the tools as such but rather as an authoritative knowledge base. Therefore, this work has implications for educators considering the use of LLMs as discussion partners or tools to practice critical thinking, especially in computing ethics education.},

abstract = {Crafting effective features is a crucial yet labor-intensive and domain-specific task within machine learning pipelines. Fortunately, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating various data science tasks, including feature engineering. But despite this potential, evaluations thus far are primarily based on the end performance of a complete ML pipeline, providing limited insight into precisely how LLMs behave relative to human experts in feature engineering. To address this gap, we propose ELF-Gym, a framework for Evaluating LLM-generated Features. We curated a new dataset from historical Kaggle competitions, including 251 golden features used by top-performing teams. ELF-Gym then quantitatively evaluates LLM-generated features by measuring their impact on downstream model performance as well as their alignment with expert-crafted features through semantic and functional similarity assessments. This approach provides a more comprehensive evaluation of disparities between LLMs and human experts, while offering valuable insights into specific areas where LLMs may have room for improvement. For example, using ELF-Gym we empirically demonstrate that, in the best-case scenario, LLMs can semantically capture approximately 56% of the golden features, but at the more demanding implementation level this overlap drops to 13%. Moreover, in other cases LLMs may fail completely, particularly on datasets that require complex features, indicating broad potential pathways for improvement.},

abstract = {Code generation aims to generate source code implementing human requirements illustrated with natural language specifications. With the rapid development of intelligent software engineering, automated code generation has become a hot research topic in both artificial intelligence and software engineering, and researchers have made significant achievements on code generation. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance on code generation tasks, such as ChatGPT released by OpenAI presents the fantastic potential on automated code generation. However, the existing studies are limited to exploring LLMs' ability for generating code snippets to solve simple programming problems, the task of competition-level code generation has never been investigated. The specifications of the programming competition are always complicated and require the specific input/output format as well as the high-level algorithmic reasoning ability. In this study, we conduct the first large empirical study to investigate the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT for solving competition programming problems. Specifically, we warm up the design of prompts by using the Human-Eval dataset. Then, we apply the well-designed prompt to the competition-level code generation dataset, namely APPS, to further explore the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for solving competition problems. We collect ChatGPT's outputs on 5,000 code competition problems, the evaluation results show that it can successfully pass 25.4% test cases. By further feeding extra information (e.g, test failed information) to ChatGPT, we observe that ChatGPT has the potential to fix partial pass into a fully pass program. Moreover, we investigate the solutions generated by LLMs and the existing solutions, we find that it prefers to directly copy the code instead of re-write when facing more difficult problems. Finally, we evaluate the code quality generated by ChatGPT in terms of "code cleanness", we observe that the generated codes are with small functions and file sizes, which are in line with the standard of clean code.},

abstract = {Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students’ use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course&nbsp;(n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools.},

AIDEs are programming tools that, given comments or starter code, can generate code solution suggestions. As the accuracy of these tools continues to increase, one particular AIDE from Github, Copilot, has been gaining significant attention for its performance and ease of use. The rise of Copilot suggests that code solution generation tools will soon be commonplace in both the industry and in computer science courses, with expert and novice programmers alike benefiting from using these tools. More specifically for novices, the effects of Copilot on the process of learning to code are mostly unknown. In this paper, we perform initial explorations into these effects. Using introductory computer science and data science courses, we evaluate Copilot-generated programming assignment solutions for correctness, style, skill level appropriateness, grade scores, and potential plagiarism. Our findings indicate Copilot generates mostly unique code that can solve introductory assignments with human-graded scores ranging from 68% to 95%. Based on these results, we provide recommendations for educators to help adapt their courses to incorporate new AIDE-based programming workflows.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have exhibited promising capabilities in addressing various tasks such as defect detection and program repair. Despite their prevalence, LLMs still face limitations in effectively handling these tasks. Common strategies to adapt them and improve their performance for specific tasks involve fine-tuning models based on user data or employing in-context learning with examples of desired inputs and outputs.    However, they pose challenges for practical adoption due to the need for extensive computational resources, high-quality data, and continuous maintenance. Furthermore, neither strategy can explain or reason about the deficiencies of LLMs in the given tasks.         We propose Calico to address the high cost of fine-tuning, eliminate the necessity for task-specific examples, and provide explanations of LLM deficiency. At the heart of Calico is an evolutionary approach that interleaves knowledge calibration and AI deficiency diagnosis. The key essence of Calico is as follows. First, it focuses on identifying knowledge gaps in LLMs’ program comprehension. Second, it conducts automated code refactoring to integrate the overlooked knowledge into the source code for mitigating those gaps. Third, it employs what-if analysis and counterfactual reasoning to determine a minimum set of overlooked knowledge necessary to improve the performance of LLMs in code tasks.        We have extensively evaluated Calico over 8,938 programs on three most commonly seen code tasks. Our experimental results show that vanilla ChatGPT cannot fully understand code structures. With knowledge calibration, Calico improves it by 20% and exhibits comparable proficiency compared to fine-tuned LLMs. Deficiency diagnosis contributes to 8% reduction in program sizes while ensuring performance. These impressive results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a vanilla LLM for automated software engineering (SE) tasks, thereby avoiding the high computational costs associated with a fine-tuned model.},

To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

abstract = {Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT&nbsp;[8] and GPT-4&nbsp;[9] could enhance programming education in various roles, e.g., by acting as a personalized digital tutor for a student, a digital assistant for an educator, and a digital peer for collaborative learning&nbsp;[1, 2, 7]. In our work, we seek to comprehensively evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art large language models for various scenarios in programming education. Recent works have evaluated several large language models in the context of programming education&nbsp;[4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org &nbsp;[5] (see Figure&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

abstract = {Learning effective representations of source code is critical for any Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) system. Inspired by natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) like Codex and CodeGen treat code as generic sequences of text and are trained on huge corpora of code data, achieving state of the art performance on several software engineering (SE) tasks. However, valid source code, unlike natural language, follows a strict structure and pattern governed by the underlying grammar of the programming language. Current LLMs do not exploit this property of the source code as they treat code like a sequence of tokens and overlook key structural and semantic properties of code that can be extracted from code-views like the Control Flow Graph (CFG), Data Flow Graph (DFG), Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), etc. Unfortunately, the process of generating and integrating code-views for every programming language is cumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this barrier, we propose our tool COMEX - a framework that allows researchers and developers to create and combine multiple code-views which can be used by machine learning (ML) models for various SE tasks. Some salient features of our tool are: (i) it works directly on source code (which need not be compilable), (ii) it currently supports Java and C#, (iii) it can analyze both method-level snippets and program-level snippets by using both intra-procedural and inter-procedural analysis, and (iv) it is easily extendable to other languages as it is built on tree-sitter - a widely used incremental parser that supports over 40 languages. We believe this easy-to-use code-view generation and customization tool will give impetus to research in source code representation learning methods and ML4SE. The source code and demonstration of our tool can be found at https://github.com/IBM/tree-sitter-codeviews and https://youtu.be/GER6U87FVbU, respectively.},

abstract = {Commit messages concisely describe code changes in natural language and are important for software maintenance. Various automatic commit message generation approaches have been proposed, such as retrieval-based, learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Recently, large language models have shown impressive performance in many natural language processing tasks. Among them, ChatGPT is the most popular one and has attracted wide attention from the software engineering community. ChatGPT demonstrates the ability of in-context learning (ICL), which allows ChatGPT to perform downstream tasks by learning from just a few demonstrations without explicit model tuning. However, it remains unclear how well ChatGPT performs in the commit message generation task via ICL. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT with ICL on commit message generation. Specifically, we first explore the impact of two key settings on the performance of ICL on commit message generation. Then, based on the best settings, we compare ChatGPT with several state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that a carefully-designed demonstration can lead to substantial improvements for ChatGPT on commit message generation. Furthermore, ChatGPT outperforms all the retrieval-based and learning-based approaches in terms of BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and Cider, and is comparable to hybrid approaches. Based on our findings, we outline several open challenges and opportunities for ChatGPT-based commit message generation.},

abstract = {Teaching computer science at scale can be challenging. From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas (e.g. natural language processing, software engineering, etc.) by achieving state-of-the-art performance on extensive downstream tasks. Aiming to achieve robust and general artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in model size, the state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting1.},

The tool aims to streamline the process of manually verifying these visualisations in the ML development cycle, which is critical as real-world data and assumptions often change post-deployment. In a prior study, we mined 54, 070 Jupyter notebooks from Github and created a catalogue of 269 semantically related visualisation-assertion (VA) pairs. Building on this catalogue, we propose to build a taxonomy that organises the VA pairs based on ML verification tasks. The input feature space comprises of a rich source of information mined from the Jupyter notebooks---visualisations, Python source code, and associated markdown text. The effectiveness of various AI models, including traditional NLP4Code models and modern Large Language Models, will be compared using established machine translation metrics and evaluated through a qualitative study with human participants. The paper also plans to address the challenge of extending the existing VA pair dataset with additional pairs from Kaggle and to compare the tool's effectiveness with commercial generative AI models like ChatGPT. This research not only contributes to the field of ML system validation but also explores novel ways to leverage AI for automating and enhancing software engineering practices in ML.},

However, it is still unknown how they cope with Object Oriented Programming assignments, where the students are asked to design and implement several interrelated classes (either by composition or inheritance) that follow a set of best-practices. Since the majority of the exercises in these tools' training dataset are written in English, it is also unclear how well they function with exercises published in other languages.In this paper, we report our experience using GPT-3 to solve 6 real-world tasks used in an Object Oriented Programming course at a Portuguese University and written in Portuguese. Our observations, based on an objective evaluation of the code, performed by an open-source Automatic Assessment Tool, show that GPT-3 is able to interpret and handle direct functional requirements, however it tends not to give the best solution in terms of object oriented design. We perform a qualitative analysis of GPT-3's output, and gather a set of recommendations for computer science educators, since we expect students to use and abuse this tool in their academic work.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous use of online tools, contractors and homework sites, has made plagiarism a concerning topic in computer science education. With the introduction of ChatGPT, it poses a threat now more than ever. Many cheating detection tools, such as similarity checkers and style anomaly checkers, help instructors decide whether a student has plagiarized. However, these are not scalable to large classes. Similarity tools can produce high rates of suspected cheating and thus ineffectively use an instructor's time in weeding out the actual cheating cases, especially in the early weeks of CS courses where programs can be small and student solutions can be very similar. We developed a new approach using outlier detection to filter inconsistent performers based on their lab scores throughout the course and their midterm exam scores. Instructors can then manually analyze a manageable amount of students even with large class sizes. We performed our experiment on two large course offerings of CS1 (a total of 177 students) using our algorithm and compared it to a manual analysis performed by an experienced CS1 instructor. The detection approach identified 11 students in the first offering (Winter 2019) and 12 students in the second offering (Spring 2023). With an average precision of 83%, our tool produces a list of concerning students with high precision. This significantly helps teachers efficiently allocate their time and pursue cheating early in the term in order to address and prevent further issues.},

The robot attributes include embodiment, nonverbal and verbal communication, perceived gender and race, emotions, perceived personality, and competence.

We identify four differences between one human and one robot settings and team settings and use them as the springboard to generalize insights from the literature review to the design and impact of a robot in assisting humans in knowledge work teams. We report two high-level observations around the interplay among robot attributes and context dependent designs and discuss their implications.},

While some advocate to ban the tools entirely, others suggest embracing them so that students develop the skills for utilizing the tools safely and responsibly. Studies indicate positive impacts, as well as cautions, on student outcomes when these tools are integrated into courses. We studied the impact of incorporating instruction on industry-standard generative AI tools into a mid-level software development course with students from 16 Minority Serving Institutions. 89% of student participants used generative AI tools prior to the course without any formal instruction. After formal instruction, students most frequently used generative AI tools for explaining concepts and learning new things. Students generally reported positive viewpoints on their ability to learn to program and learn problem-solving skills while using generative AI tools. Finally, we found that students: reported to understand their code when they work with generative AI tools, are critical about the outputs that generative AI tools provide, and check outputs of generative AI tools to ensure accuracy.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is nowadays widely used for different purposes and with several disciplines. From self-driving cars to automated medical diagnosis, machine learning models extensively support users’ daily activities, and software engineering tasks are no exception. Not embracing good ML practices may lead to pitfalls that hinder the performance of an ML system and potentially lead to unexpected results. Despite the existence of documentation and literature about ML best practices, many non-ML experts turn towards gray literature like blogs and Q&amp;A systems when looking for help and guidance when implementing ML systems. To better aid users in distilling relevant knowledge from such sources, we propose a recommender system that recommends ML practices based on the user’s context. As a first step in creating a recommender system for machine learning practices, we implemented Idaka. A tool that provides two different approaches for retrieving/generating ML best practices: i) an information retrieval (IR) engine and ii) a large language model. The IR-engine uses BM25 as the algorithm for retrieving the practices, and a large language model, in our case Alpaca. The platform has been designed to allow comparative studies of best practices retrieval tools. Idaka is publicly available at  GitHub: https://bit.ly/idaka. Video: https://youtu.be/cEb-AhIPxnM},

abstract = {Instructional videos are becoming increasingly popular among computer science students. Over 78% of students frequently visit YouTube to find videos as supplement to their textbook or classroom instruction[1]. Recent surveys show that on average, 73% of students prefer having their instructors curate a supplemental video library to aid in their learning. Now, the emergence of generative AI is revolutionizing supplemental video instruction, enabling instructors to generate slides, recording scripts, and produce high-quality videos with deep search and embedded interactive activities.Generative AI also takes the student video learning to a new level by providing AI-generated video summaries, on-demand questions, and exploration of topics in greater depth. Integrating AI into standard videos greatly expands the possibilities of video-based learning. This workshop demonstrates how educators can enhance their existing video playlists by incorporating AI to increase student engagement and establish safety measures for AI use in education. By using dynamic dashboards, scheduled content, and gamified questions, instructors can maintain student focus.Drawing on insights from computer science courses taught at Princeton and Rutgers Universities, we will highlight the transformative potential of AI-enhanced videos in promoting active learning, particularly in large classes. We will discuss engagement strategies and real-time data visualizations applicable to any video platform. We will utilize the cubits.ai[2] platform, a Princeton University initiative that enhances the impact of computer science courses. The platform is free, and participants are encouraged to bring their own video playlists to curate them into AI-enabled collections by enhancing the student experience through integrated generative AI.},

abstract = {Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life, many opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence. Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a specific area: responding to student programmers’ help requests. More specifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic code that students request help on. Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online programming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and GPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students’ code and assessed the LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently find at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90% of the cases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57% of the time). False positives are common (40% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice that the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better on issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model solutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM responses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than responses to English prompts. Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in programming education. At the same time, the results highlight the unreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do, perhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment systems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future efforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.},

abstract = {The rising popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated exploring their use in code-related tasks. Code LLMs with more than millions of parameters are trained on a massive amount of code in different Programming Languages (PLs). Such models are used for automating various Software Engineering (SE) tasks using prompt engineering. However, given the very large size of industry-scale project files, a major issue of these LLMs is their limited context window size, motivating the question of "Can these LLMs process very large files and can we effectively perform prompt engineering?". Code translation aims to convert source code from one PL to another. In this work, we assess the effect of method-level program decomposition on context window of LLMs and investigate how this approach can enable translation of very large files which originally could not be done due to out-of-context issue. Our observations from 20 well-known java projects and approximately 60K methods suggest that method-level program decomposition significantly improves the limited context window problem of LLMs by 99.5%. Furthermore, our empirical analysis indicate that with method-level decomposition, each input fragment on average only consumes 5% of the context window, leaving more context space for prompt engineering and the output. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of a Call Graph (CG) approach for translating very large files when doing method-level program decomposition.},

Recent educational initiatives have focused on enhancing CS and engineering students' AI ethics education but have largely overlooked integrating these concepts across other disciplines. This paper presents and assesses a pioneering initiative that integrates AI ethics into university curricula through a collaborative framework between CS and domain educators. We introduced 1-3 week AI ethics modules in seven diverse courses from Art to Chemistry, incorporating case studies and hands-on activities using chat- or image-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Student surveys indicated significant gains in confidence regarding AI ethics discussions, application of principles, and reasoning skills. Our approach advocates for utilizing structured frameworks and faculty collaboration in embedding AI ethics into university curricula, enhancing students' practical skills and ethical understanding across diverse professional settings.},

abstract = {Computer science (CS) programs have a variety of reasons for regularly reviewing and revising the curriculum for their undergraduate major. Some of these stem from the rapid pace of change in the discipline and corresponding changes in industry expectations for CS graduates. This has been most recently seen as departments consider how to adjust to advances in generative AI and respond to new international curricular guidelines in the form of CS2023 [1]. Programs also revise their CS major in response to contextual shifts at their institution, such as changes in the size and makeup of the student body, the resources and staffing of a program, assessment results, or new institutional priorities [6]. A shifting student body may come with changes in prior experience with computing and in the professional goals of the students. For smaller programs, staffing changes often affect the balance of expertise within subareas of CS. New institutional priorities such as enabling more study abroad experiences or embedding internship/service-learning into the curriculum can require majors to adjust to both accommodate and support these priorities.},

abstract = {Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs. By training a black box machine learning model and “explaining” its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks. However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes. In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models. By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code. We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects. Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans. Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT’s explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%). Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.},

Unlike existing research, which primarily focuses on introductory classes and lacks in-depth analysis of actual student-LLM interactions, our work fills this gap. We conducted a comprehensive analysis involving 411 students from a Distributed Systems class at an Indian university, where they completed three programming assignments and shared their experiences through Google Form surveys and interviews.Our findings reveal that students leveraged LLMs for a variety of tasks, including code generation, debugging, conceptual inquiries, and test case creation. They employed a spectrum of prompting strategies, ranging from basic contextual prompts to advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative refinement. While students generally viewed LLMs as beneficial for enhancing productivity and learning, we noted a concerning trend of over-reliance, with many students submitting entire assignment descriptions to obtain complete solutions. Given the increasing use of LLMs in the software industry, our study highlights the need to update undergraduate curricula to include training on effective prompting strategies and to raise awareness about the benefits and potential drawbacks of LLM usage in academic settings.},

abstract = {Self-regulation refers to the ability to plan, monitor, control and reflect on one's problem-solving process. Prior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve novice performance in solving programming problems. However, with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process.On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design new interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework that incorporates use of generative AI tools in programming problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides exploration of the design space of interventions that integrate generative AI in CS education.},

abstract = {Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized learning in computing education is promising, yet cloud-based LLMs pose risks around data security and privacy. To address these concerns, we developed and deployed a locally stored Small Language Model (SLM) utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. Previous work has demonstrated that SLMs can match or surpass popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) in handling conversational data from a CS1 course. We deployed SLMs with RAG (SLM + RAG) in a large course with more than 250 active students, fielding nearly 2,000 student questions, while evaluating data privacy, scalability, and feasibility of local deployments. This paper provides a comprehensive guide for deploying SLM + RAG systems, detailing model selection, vector database choice, embedding methods, and pipeline frameworks. We share practical insights from our deployment, including scalability concerns, accuracy versus context length trade-offs, guardrails and hallucination reduction, as well as data privacy maintenance. We address the "Impossible Triangle" in RAG systems, which states that achieving high accuracy, short context length, and low time consumption simultaneously is not feasible. Furthermore, our novel RAG framework, Intelligence Concentration (IC), categorizes information into multiple layers of abstraction within Milvus collections mitigating trade-offs and enabling educational assistants to deliver more relevant and personalized responses to students quickly.},

We investigate an opportunity for a positive impact of LLMs on NNES through multilingual programming exercise generation. Following previous work with LLM exercise generation in English, we prompt OpenAI GPT-3.5 in 4 natural languages (English, Tamil, Spanish, and Vietnamese) to create introductory programming problems, sample solutions, and test cases. We evaluate these problems on their sensibility, readability, translation, sample solution accuracy, topicality, and cultural relevance. We find that problems generated in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese are largely sensible, easily understood, and accurate in their sample solutions. However, Tamil problems are mostly non-sensible and have a much lower passing test rate, indicating that the abilities of LLMs for problem generation are not generalizable across languages. Our analysis suggests that these problems could not be given verbatim to students, but with minimal effort, most errors can be fixed. We further discuss the benefits of these problems despite their flaws, and their opportunities to provide personalized and culturally relevant resources for students in their native languages.},

abstract = {Learning-based techniques, especially advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) for code, have gained considerable popularity in various software engineering (SE) tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing better learning-based models and pay less attention to the properties of datasets. Learning-based models, including popular LLMs for code, heavily rely on data, and the data's properties (e.g., data distribution) could significantly affect their behavior. We conducted an exploratory study on the distribution of SE data and found that such data usually follows a skewed distribution (i.e., long-tailed distribution) where a small number of classes have an extensive collection of samples, while a large number of classes have very few samples. We investigate three distinct SE tasks and analyze the impacts of long-tailed distribution on the performance of LLMs for code. Our experimental results reveal that the long-tailed distribution has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of LLMs for code. Specifically, LLMs for code perform between 30.0% and 254.0% worse on data samples associated with infrequent labels compared to data samples of frequent labels. Our study provides a better understanding of the effects of long-tailed distributions on popular LLMs for code and insights for the future development of SE automation.},

We posit that efforts to address and alleviate these LLM challenges—hallucinations, unpredictable outputs, lack of transparency, and difficulties in customization—cannot be solved through algorithmic improvements alone but require elevated mixed-initiative interface design at the heart of the IUI community. This workshop aims to bridge the gap between agent-driven automation and direct manipulation by exploring mixed-initiative interaction models that blend the strengths of both paradigms to empower end-users seeking to harness LLMs.},

abstract = {The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML, given natural language prompt.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user edited suggestions, as well as user sentiments analysis. The evaluation is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users of code assistants for domain-specific languages. We are also the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures, which is 13.66% on Day 30. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate, called Strong Acceptance rate, where a suggestion is considered accepted only if less than 50% of it is edited and these edits do not change critical parts of the suggestion. By focusing on Ansible, Lightspeed is able to achieve a strong acceptance rate of 49.08% for multi-line Ansible task suggestions. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context. We hope this work serves as a reference for software engineering and machine learning researchers exploring code completion.},

abstract = {Programming has been considered the "essence of informatics" since the beginning of computing as a discipline. But programming in the fifties was very different from what we know today, and one of the goals (or dreams) throughout the history of programming language technology, has been "automatic programming''---the ability to automatically generate computer code starting from a high(er)-level description of the specification of that code. What this meant changed over the years, from punching paper tape, to compiling high-level programming languages, to program synthesis.Today, however, the availability of machine learning artefacts that produce high-level code from natural language specifications has completely changed the traditional meaning. To the extent that some computer scientists have begun to question the received wisdom that the core of their discipline is deeply rooted in programming.If programming and programming languages are no longer the essence of computer science, this changes the epistemology of the discipline itself. Moreover, if we are at the end of programming, we should also change the curriculum, where programming, algorithms and programming languages play a major role. Several recent papers reviewed the performance of code generators based on large language models on typical CS1 problems (e.g., from the many possible citations and how machine learning impacts K-12 teaching.Starting from this data, I will argue for the role of programming in the curriculum, distinguishing between programming taught as part of a holistic curriculum (as in some non-technical high schools) or as a vocational tool. I will use Simondon's notion of (closed and open) technical object as an interpretive lens, together with Calvino's reflections on the availability of writing machines capable of replacing the poet and the author.},

abstract = {The sudden emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has had a disruptive impact throughout the computing education community. LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages—for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with n = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students’ time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.},

In this work, we introduce a low-overhead, natural language processing tool that can assist instructors in extracting student talking points from over 600 discussion forum posts in a large-scale undergraduate computing ethics course. When compared to large language model approaches, this n-gram-based scripting tool is more effective in selecting popular quotes and summarizing course discussion.

ACCESS provides high performance computing (HPC) resources to researchers by allocating time at computing centers at diverse institutions of higher education across the United States. Effectively implementing a large language model on a limited knowledge base for the diversity of the resources and technical nature of HPC in general has raised questions in optimal knowledge base construction. The following analysis takes a limited test case to investigate the driving factors contributing to the accuracy of the chatbot’s response to predetermined prompts, specifically regarding the clusters on which specific software applications are currently available. It additionally tests the necessity of providing documentation of synonymous terms in the form of a synonym dictionary in the knowledge base. While ongoing, this initial research utilizing logistic regression suggests the knowledge base is yet insufficient for the prompts given and that the synonym dictionary has no statistically significant effect on the response.},

abstract = {Large language models are reshaping computing education. Based on recent research, these models explain code better than students, answer multiple choice questions at or above the class average, and generate code that can pass automated tests in introductory courses. In response to these capabilities, instructors have quickly adjusted their courses and assessment methods to align with shifting learning goals and the increased risk of academic integrity issues. While some scholars have advocated for the integration of visual problems as a safeguard against the capabilities of language models, new multimodal models now have vision and language capabilities that may allow them to analyze and solve visual problems. In this paper, we compare the large multimodal model (LMMs) GPT-4V with Bard, an LLM that uses Google Lens for text recognition. We find that LMMs, which have learned both pixel features (from images) and text features (from prompts) in the same embedding space, performed substantially better than Bard which uses a piecemeal approach. With a specific focus on Parsons problems presented across diverse visual representations, our results show that GPT-4V solved 96.7% these visual problems, struggling minimally with a single Parsons problem. Conversely, Bard performed poorly by only solving 69.2% of problems, struggling with common issues like hallucinations and refusals. These findings suggest that merely transitioning to visual programming problems might not be a panacea to issues of academic integrity in the generative AI era.},

abstract = {Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system.To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s).We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.},

And by comparing the performance of different instructions under different learning rates, the fine-tuning learning rate range suitable for the field of geological disasters is summarized. The limitation is that it is constrained by local computing resources, which reduces the parameter scale of LLM, and the recognition performance is low for extremely long or complex texts.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have become instrumental in advancing software engineering (SE) tasks, showcasing their efficacy in code understanding and beyond. AI code models have demonstrated their value not only in code generation but also in defect detection, enhancing security measures and improving overall software quality. They are emerging as crucial tools for both software development and maintaining software quality. Like traditional SE tools, open source collaboration is key in realizing the excellent products. However, with AI models, the essential need is in data. The collaboration of these AI-based SE models hinges on maximizing the sources of high-quality data. However, data, especially of high quality, often hold commercial or sensitive value, making them less accessible for open source AI-based SE projects. This reality presents a significant barrier to the development and enhancement of AI-based SE tools within the SE community. Therefore, researchers need to find solutions for enabling open source AI-based SE models to tap into resources by different organizations. Addressing this challenge, our position article investigates one solution to facilitate access to diverse organizational resources for open source AI models, ensuring that privacy and commercial sensitivities are respected. We introduce a governance framework centered on federated learning (FL), designed to foster the joint development and maintenance of open source AI code models while safeguarding data privacy and security. Additionally, we present guidelines for developers on AI-based SE tool collaboration, covering data requirements, model architecture, updating strategies, and version control. Given the significant influence of data characteristics on FL, our research examines the effect of code data heterogeneity on FL performance. We consider six different scenarios of data distributions and include four code models. We also include four most common FL algorithms. Our experimental findings highlight the potential for employing FL in the collaborative development and maintenance of AI-based SE models. We also discuss the key issues to be addressed in the co-construction process and future research directions.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of e-commerce customer service (CS) scenarios, driven by rapid product evolution and user base growth, presents unique challenges for intent recognition. Unlike generic user-generated content (UGC), CS-UGC exhibits multimodal complexity (e.g., product inquiries, return requests) that traditional methods struggle to address due to (1) Limited CS domain-specific knowledge, which hampers the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle multimodal CS data, and (2) The complexity and noise in CS UGC, which undermines the robustness of traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose Customer Service Augmented LLM Merge (CuSMer), a novel framework integrating semi-supervised learning with model merging techniques through dual pipelines: (i) pseudo-labeling → fine-tuning → LLM merging and (ii) image augmentation → fine-tuning → LLM merging. These piplines enhance the robustness of LLMs against noisy, out-of-distribution data while improving their multimodal understanding of CS scenarios. Evaluated on Alibaba's real-world datasets, CuSMer demonstrates superior robustness in noisy environments and enhanced multimodal understanding compared to baseline LLMs. It achieved third place in the first round and first place in the final round in the WWW25 - Competition: Multimodal Dialogue System Intent Recognition Challenge, validating its scalability and effectiveness for industrial CS applications.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically generative AI (GenAI) are threatening to fundamentally reshape computing and society. Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving.There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms.},

abstract = {The recent public releases of AI tools such as ChatGPT have forced computer science educators to reconsider how they teach. These tools have demonstrated considerable ability to generate code and answer conceptual questions, rendering them incredibly useful for completing CS coursework. While overreliance on AI tools could hinder students’ learning, we believe they have the potential to be a helpful resource for both students and instructors alike. We propose a novel system for instructor-mediated GPT interaction in a class discussion board. By automatically generating draft responses to student forum posts, GPT can help Teaching Assistants (TAs) respond to student questions in a more timely manner, giving students an avenue to receive fast, quality feedback on their solutions without turning to ChatGPT directly. Additionally, since they are involved in the process, instructors can ensure that the information students receive is accurate, and can provide students with incremental hints that encourage them to engage critically with the material, rather than just copying an AI-generated snippet of code. We utilize Piazza—a popular educational forum where TAs help students via text exchanges—as a venue for GPT-assisted TA responses to student questions. These student questions are sent to GPT-4 alongside assignment instructions and a customizable prompt, both of which are stored in editable instructor-only Piazza posts. We demonstrate an initial implementation of this system, and provide examples of student questions that highlight its benefits.},

abstract = {The task of decomposing a problem into sub-problems to build a solution, also formalized as planning in prior work, is a key skill for programming expertise. Improving the decomposition and planning skills of novices is shown to be a challenging goal for educators. Moreover, decomposing complex projects into smaller subtasks is an increasingly relevant skill with rapid developments in tools like large language models (LLMs). While there are many aspects of planning, one skill consistently observed in studies with experts is the ability to identify subtasks that can be solved via common code patterns. To support students in acquiring these skills, many researchers have explored explicit instruction about a set of common patterns in programs (i.e. programming plans). However, recent work implies that students may need additional support to fully benefit from such interventions. This panel aims to bring computing education researchers together to discuss the main challenges around teaching decomposition and planning using common patterns, the crucial factors for designing instruction for teaching these concepts, and the impact evolving technology like LLMs can have on these developments.},

Matching of NodeGrade’s output with multiple human expert raters reveals some weaknesses regarding cases at the lower and upper boundary. In terms of user experience, the interviewed and observed students recognized both positive facets, like better learning support and helpful feedback, and negative sides, including technical limitations and lack of transparency. Overall, NodeGrade promises high potential for further practical use and testing in the field of software engineering education and automatic short answer grading.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) present an exciting opportunity for generating synthetic classroom data. Such data could include code containing a typical distribution of errors, simulated student behavior to address the cold start problem when developing education tools, and synthetic user data when access to authentic data is restricted due to privacy reasons. In this research paper, we conduct a comparative study examining the distribution of bugs generated by LLMs in contrast to those produced by computing students. Leveraging data from two previous large-scale analyses of student-generated bugs, we investigate whether LLMs can be coaxed to exhibit bug patterns that are similar to authentic student bugs when prompted to inject errors into code. The results suggest that unguided, LLMs do not generate plausible error distributions, and many of the generated errors are unlikely to be generated by real students. However, with guidance including descriptions of common errors and typical frequencies, LLMs can be shepherded to generate realistic distributions of errors in synthetic code.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) generative tools, commonly referred to as AI-based tools, have become integral in various computing domains, including education. The widespread adoption of these tools has raised concerns among educators, spanning from issues related to plagiarism and comprehension gaps to potential threats to student identity. Consequently, educators are grappling with how to adapt their courses and incorporate AI technologies into their curriculum and pedagogical approaches. In addition to navigating challenges associated with AI regulations, educators face the compounded difficulty of addressing post-pandemic issues, such as students displaying diminished effort and professionalism in the classroom. The convergence of these two challenges creates a complex scenario that intertwines technical and professional considerations. Within the Computer Science Fundamentals course, commonly referred to as CS 1, the learning process revolves around comprehending programming through a sequential understanding of steps, as each concept builds upon the preceding one. This investigation centers on the CS 1 curriculum within an American two-year program, commonly known as a community college. The objective is to address a problem by leveraging an AI tool within team settings. The study assesses both problem-solving capabilities and the effectiveness of teamwork, providing recommendations to guide students in the proper utilization of AI tools. The emphasis is on fostering contextual relevance and collaborative work within the generative learning process.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for the automatic generation of feedback in a wide range of computing contexts. However, concerns have been voiced around the privacy and ethical implications of sending student work to proprietary models. This has sparked considerable interest in the use of open source LLMs in education, but the quality of the feedback that such open models can produce remains understudied. This is a concern as providing flawed or misleading generated feedback could be detrimental to student learning. Inspired by recent work that has utilised very powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the outputs produced by less powerful models, we conduct an automated analysis of the quality of the feedback produced by several open source models using a dataset from an introductory programming course. First, we investigate the viability of employing GPT-4 as an automated evaluator by comparing its evaluations with those of a human expert. We observe that GPT-4 demonstrates a bias toward positively rating feedback while exhibiting moderate agreement with human raters, showcasing its potential as a feedback evaluator. Second, we explore the quality of feedback generated by several leading open-source LLMs by using GPT-4 to evaluate the feedback. We find that some models offer competitive performance with popular proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, indicating opportunities for their responsible use in educational settings.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) libraries have significantly impacted various domains in computer science over the last decade. However, developers often face challenges when using the DL APIs, as the development paradigm of DL applications differs greatly from traditional software development. Existing studies on API misuse mainly focus on traditional software, leaving a gap in understanding API misuse within DL APIs. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of DL API misuse in TensorFlow and PyTorch. Specifically, we first collected a dataset of 4,224 commits from the top 200 most-starred projects using these two libraries and manually identified 891 API misuses. We then investigated the characteristics of these misuses from three perspectives, i.e., types, root causes, and symptoms. We have also conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the current state-of-the-art API misuse detector on our 891 confirmed API misuses. Our results confirmed that the state-of-the-art API misuse detector is ineffective in detecting DL API misuses. To address the limitations of existing API misuse detection for DL APIs, we propose LLMAPIDet, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for DL API misuse detection and repair. We build LLMAPIDet by prompt-tuning a chain of ChatGPT prompts on 600 out of 891 confirmed API misuses and reserve the rest 291 API misuses as the testing dataset. Our evaluation shows that LLMAPIDet can detect 48 out of the 291 DL API misuses while none of them can be detected by the existing API misuse detector. We further evaluate LLMAPIDet on the latest versions of 10 GitHub projects. The evaluation shows that LLMAPIDet can identify 119 previously unknown API misuses and successfully fix 46 of them.},

Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER, however, has focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments and judging the quality of programming feedback, contrasting the results with proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to introductory Python programming exercises suggest that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs are nearly on par with proprietary models in both generating and assessing programming feedback. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in these tasks and highlight the wide range of LLMs accessible, even for free, to educators and practitioners.},

Colab is used extensively for teaching computer science and machine learning, giving equitable access to expensive resources and AI/ML instruction to students around the world, regardless of background. As one professor stated: ''There's an equity aspect. Not everyone has a high-end laptop. Being able to say everyone has the same computing experience and they all have access to the same resources and they can start using them right away, it allows us to find more talent randomly distributed around our student population. Colab has been the best solution so far.'' Additionally, Google Colab partners with Google DeepMind to launch innovative AI coding features and models to the public, giving users the ability to author code with natural language, a much simpler experience for writing code. We are the team who builds Colab, and would love to demo our latest features, including Google Classroom integration and AI coding using Gemini, Google's latest foundation AI model. We hope to make attendees aware of these features and have them give us feedback on their usefulness and impact on the process of teaching computer science and machine learning.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. We plan to share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

abstract = {With the mainstream adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), members of both academia and the media have raised concerns around their impact on student learning and pedagogy. Many students and educators wonder about the pedagogical fit of this emerging technology. We aim to measure the adoption of and attitudes toward LLMs among the CS student population at an R1 University to determine how students are using these new tools. To this end, we conducted a large survey study targeting two populations participating in computing courses at the university: intro-sequence students (ISS) and experienced students (ES).In our preliminary results from Spring 2023, we've found several significant differences among the views of over 700 respondents across the two groups. Most students reported LLMs' unparalleled potential for quick information access, yet many harbor concerns about the reliability of the LLM responses, and the impact on academic integrity. Additionally, while ES have rapidly integrated LLMs into their learning, ISS remain cautious of the tools, highlighting a stark contrast in adoption rates between the groups.LLMs are clearly going to reshape pedagogical approaches and student engagement. Our study hopes to provide insight on the nuanced student attitudes toward LLMs. For example, the notable reservations expressed by ISS illustrate an imperative for careful, informed, and ethical integration to ensure these tools enhance rather than compromise the educational experience. In the future, we plan to continue tracking student attitudes in order to gain further understanding of the changing perceptions of LLMs and their impact.},

abstract = {Despite the exponential growth in demand for advanced computational skills driven by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, higher education institutions still face a significant shortage of dedicated course offerings pertaining to High Performance Computing (HPC). This educational deficiency not only hampers the preparedness of undergraduate students for cutting-edge postgraduate programs but also impairs their readiness to enter a dynamic workforce increasingly reliant on sophisticated computational capabilities. Integrating comprehensive HPC courses at the undergraduate level is critical for equipping students with expertise to effectively utilize modern computing technologies, and also for bridging the growing gap between academic preparation and industry demands. At Wake Forest University (WFU), we, members of the HPC Team, are actively working to address the educational gap in HPC by integrating the WFU HPC Facility[4] into higher-level elective courses across various disciplines. Recognizing the foundational importance of these skills, we have developed an introductory course specifically designed to equip students with the knowledge to excel in advanced courses, in graduate and research programs, and to meet the demands of the modern workforce. By integrating the WFU HPC Facility into our curriculum, the University is committed to pioneering a comprehensive educational pathway that empowers students to leverage the full potential of computing technologies in their future careers. WFU is an R-2 liberal arts institution with around 9,000 students[6] that actively supports undergraduate research through a multitude of departments and programs. Undergraduate research is so paramount to the University mission, that WFU has a dedicated center, the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) Center, just for this purpose. Many students engage in research projects that leverage the resources of the WFU HPC Facility. The facility’s main asset, the Distributed Environment for Academic Computing (DEAC) Cluster, contains approximately 4000 CPU cores and 20TB of RAM, and is a true interdisciplinary tool; in 2023 it was utilized by 15 departments and 500 active users to submit over 1.5 million computational tasks on a vast array of research topics. The interdisciplinary nature of the DEAC Cluster played an instrumental role in developing an introductory course in HPC that caters to students from a diverse number of majors. Having supported a wide range of researchers, we designed the course to bridge concepts and applications from Computer Science, Engineering, Data Science, and the Natural Sciences to their respective academic domains. By enabling students from multiple disciplines to access foundational HPC skills, we foster a versatile educational environment where collaborative and interdisciplinary learning thrives. One way that we ensure our introductory course is accessible to all students is that we do not require any prerequisite classes to enroll in the course. Students are also not expected to have any prior experience in programming. We have chosen Python as the primary programming language for the course, as it is one of the most versatile and widely-used languages in the fields of data science and machine learning, and can easily interface with parallel frameworks such as MPI and OpenMP. Students gain hands-on experience by developing asynchronous workflows, which are then executed on the DEAC Cluster. This practical focus not only demystifies complex computational concepts but also empowers students to apply their learning in real-world scenarios. HPC serves as a cornerstone for two distinct user groups, each integral to its advancement and application. The first encompasses those who enable and optimize HPC systems, including Computer Scientists, Computer Engineers, Systems Administrators, and Cyberinfrastructure Professionals, who enhance computational efficiency and build the underlying hardware infrastructure. The second group comprises scientists and researchers across diverse fields such as Statistics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Engineering, and more, who leverage HPC as a powerful tool for simulating complex phenomena, analyzing large datasets, and researching novel problems in their respective domains. While current course offerings at other institutions seem to prioritize the first group and educate students on how to build and enable an HPC cluster, we have chosen to prioritize curriculum for the second group as the skills they gain through our course’s curriculum will help them as they continue their academic career in higher level electives and independent research projects with faculty advisors. We choose to offer our course during the Spring semester in order to prepare students who may want to pursue research during the summer session. The first half of the course serves as foundational cluster training, familiarizing students with essential skills to work within an HPC environment. In this segment, students delve into the Linux command line interface (CLI) using Bashcrawl[3] and explore the intricacies of the Linux filesystem and environment modules. A significant focus is placed on understanding and utilizing job schedulers, such as the Slurm resource manager[2]. Another unique feature of this segment is the guided tour of the Wake Forest datacenter. This tour provides students with a tangible understanding of how the theoretical concepts discussed in class are implemented in a real-world HPC cluster. To further provide a reference to the resources requested for their jobs through Slurm, the tour concludes with students disassembling retired compute nodes to learn about the different components that comprise modern servers. The midterm assessment challenges students to submit multiple jobs, analyzing the effects of varying input sizes and the use of multiple CPU processors on calculation speed. Upon completion of this initial phase, students are fully equipped to engage in research activities under an advisor and effectively utilize an HPC cluster outside the confines of the classroom. Many apply for summer grants through the aforementioned URECA program with a faculty advisor. In the latter half of the course, the curriculum shifts towards more advanced topics, focusing on parallel computing frameworks and technologies. Students are introduced to MPI and OpenMP, which are essential for developing parallel applications that can run efficiently on today’s multi-processor systems. Additionally, the course delves into high-speed interconnects, crucial for optimizing communication between different parts of an HPC cluster. One of our final topics covers GPU computing, with a particular emphasis on using NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA programming platform, enabling students to harness the power of graphical processing for computational tasks. As an example from our Spring 2024 semester, students built a “chatbot” using Meta’s Llama 2 model[5] on both CPU and GPU using LLaMA C++[1], and compared its performance to ChatGPT while interacting freely with it. Our course is designed to complement other specialized courses found in Computer Science or in Computer Engineering programs, such as Parallel Algorithms, Computer Vision, or Deep Learning. It aims to introduce these critical computational concepts and provide a solid foundation that prepares students for these more advanced electives. By the end of the course, students are not only familiar with the basic principles of HPC but are also primed to tackle more specialized studies and research in their future academic and professional pursuits. It is not uncommon that a course may require students to use a specific programming language or software. While there are tools such as Google Colab and zyBooks that provide a browser-based interface to computing resources, those tools can be very limited in what resources they can provide. A faculty member might then want students to install software locally on their laptop, but this can be challenging when students bring their own device to the classroom as they may be running different operating systems or may have different hardware platforms. This can cause the software to behave differently or it may not even be available on that given platform. Courses with significant computational demands are better served utilizing a unified computing environment, and an HPC facility is ideally equipped to provide a consistent learning environment where each student has access to the same software and computing resources. A primary challenge in integrating HPC resources into coursework is instructing students on the use of schedulers for asynchronous workloads. Our introductory HPC course effectively bridges this gap by providing the necessary training and context, enabling students to engage with advanced topics more efficiently, without the steep initial learning curve typically associated with these environments. Our HPC facility has proven instrumental in enhancing educational experiences across a variety of disciplines, demonstrating significant benefits in classes such as Statistics, Natural Language Processing, Parallel Algorithms, Computer Vision, Physics Laboratory, Cancer Biology, Environmental Physics, Computational Modeling, and more. Moreover, students in fields like Finance and Business and Enterprise Management have also successfully leveraged our HPC resources, and have performed analysis on client data that was protected under a nondisclosure agreement which prevented students from storing the data locally on their laptop or with commercial cloud providers. This integration not only facilitates sophisticated computational tasks, but also allows students and faculty to easily share and store large datasets that the students may need to access without having to consume space on their local device. One of our primary goals is to promote diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration within this course, and this semester attracted a notably diverse group of students, with majors ranging from Biology and Statistics to Applied Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. Although the course is currently catalogued under the Computer Science department, we recognize that associating it with any single discipline could potentially limit its appeal and accessibility. The diverse enrollment underscores the interdisciplinary relevance of HPC skills across various fields of study. We are leveraging the current success and broad interest in the course as a foundation to establish a new academic program dedicated to High Performance Computing. This new program will serve as a hub for integrating computational skills across different disciplines, fostering a broader understanding and application of HPC in various scientific and economic sectors. The HPC team’s commitment to High Performance Computing education extends beyond traditional academic structures. While we are not developing a new major, minor, certificate track, or concentration in HPC, our objective is to make HPC education accessible and applicable across various disciplines without the constraints of a single departmental bias. This approach allows students from any field to engage with HPC skills as an integral part of their academic and professional development. To achieve this, we are actively collaborating with multiple academic departments to ensure that our HPC course offerings are recognized as fulfilling degree requirements across a range of programs. One way we collaborate with these departments is by altering activities and projects to use different languages and software, such as R and MATLAB, for the Statistics and Engineering departments, while still maintaining the same learning goals we achieve with Python. This strategy not only enhances the versatility of our course but also promotes a more comprehensive integration of the university’s HPC facilities into the curriculum. By doing so, we allow faculty in different departments to integrate our projects into their courses and utilize our HPC facility, even if it is for only one or two projects throughout the semester. Our efforts are focused on fostering a collaborative academic environment where the HPC facility is not just an isolated resource used for research but a central part of our educational infrastructure. By working across disciplines, we hope to catalyze a deeper engagement with HPC technologies throughout the university, enhancing both teaching and research capacities across departments. In conclusion, the escalating demand for big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is not only transforming industries but also reshaping educational requirements. As these fields expand, the need for substantial computational resources becomes increasingly critical. The HPC facility at Wake Forest University is exceptionally well-equipped to meet these demands, by providing a unified computing environment that supports an array of academic endeavors. Our initiative to develop introductory HPC courses is a strategic response to this need, preparing students to proficiently utilize HPC resources in higher-level electives and beyond. These courses are pivotal in bridging the gap between conventional academic programs and the rigorous computational needs of modern disciplines. Looking forward, the necessity for such educational offerings will only intensify as the reliance on advanced computational technologies grows. By anticipating and responding to these educational demands, Wake Forest University’s HPC academic program not only enhances student readiness for future challenges but also positions the university at the forefront of academic innovation in the computational sciences.},

abstract = {The scaling laws have become the de facto guidelines for designing large language models (LLMs), but they were studied under the assumption of unlimited computing resources for both training and inference. As LLMs are increasingly used as personalized intelligent assistants, their customization (i.e., learning through fine-tuning) and deployment onto resource-constrained edge devices will become more and more prevalent. An urgent but open question is how a resource-constrained computing environment would affect the design choices for a personalized LLM. We study this problem empirically in this work. In particular, we consider the tradeoffs among a number of key design factors and their intertwined impacts on learning efficiency and accuracy. The factors include the learning methods for LLM customization, the amount of personalized data used for learning customization, the types and sizes of LLMs, the compression methods of LLMs, the amount of time afforded to learn, and the difficulty levels of the target use cases. Through extensive experimentation and benchmarking, we draw a number of surprisingly insightful guidelines for deploying LLMs onto resource-constrained devices. For example, an optimal choice between parameter learning and RAG may vary depending on the difficulty of the downstream task, the longer fine-tuning time does not necessarily help the model, and a compressed LLM may be a better choice than an uncompressed LLM to learn from limited personalized data.},

Particular promise has been shown in using generative AI to enhance programming error messages. Both students and instructors have complained for decades that these messages are often cryptic and difficult to understand. Yet recent work has shown that students make fewer repeated errors when enhanced via GPT-4. We extend this work by implementing feedback from ChatGPT for all programs submitted to our automated assessment tool, Athene, providing help for compiler, run-time, and logic errors. Our results indicate that adding generative AI to an automated assessment tool does not necessarily make it better and that design of the interface matters greatly to the usability of the feedback that GPT-4 provided.},

Computing education researchers have found that LLMs can solve most assessments in introductory programming courses, including both traditional code writing tasks and other popular tasks such as Parsons problems. As more and more students start to make use of LLMs, the question instructors might ask themselves is "what can I do?". We propose that one promising way forward is to integrate LLMs into teaching practice, providing all students with an equal opportunity to learn how to interact productively with LLMs as well as encounter and understand their limitations. In this workshop, we first present state-of-the-art research results on how to utilize LLMs in computing education practice, after which participants will take part in hands-on activities using LLMs. We end the workshop by brainstorming ideas with participants around adapting their classrooms to most effectively integrate LLMs while avoiding some common pitfalls.},

abstract = {AI can enhance programming experiences for a diverse set of programmers: from professional developers and data scientists (proficient programmers) who need help in software engineering and data wrangling, all the way to spreadsheet users (low-code programmers) who need help in authoring formulas, and students (novice programmers) who seek hints when stuck with their programming homework. To communicate their need to AI, users can express their intent explicitly—as input-output examples or natural-language specification—or implicitly—where they encounter a bug (and expect AI to suggest a fix), or simply allow AI to observe their last few lines of code or edits (to have it suggest the next steps).  

The task of synthesizing an intended program snippet from the user’s intent is both a search and a ranking problem. Search is required to discover candidate programs that correspond to the (often ambiguous) intent, and ranking is required to pick the best program from multiple plausible alternatives. This creates a fertile playground for combining symbolic-reasoning techniques, which model the semantics of programming operators, and machine-learning techniques, which can model human preferences in programming. Recent advances in large language models like Codex offer further promise to advance such neuro-symbolic techniques.  

Finally, a few critical requirements in AI-assisted programming are usability, precision, and trust; and they create opportunities for innovative user experiences and interactivity paradigms. In this talk, I will explain these concepts using some existing successes, including the Flash Fill feature in Excel, Data Connectors in PowerQuery, and IntelliCode/CoPilot in Visual Studio. I will also describe several new opportunities in AI-assisted programming, which can drive the next set of foundational neuro-symbolic advances.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models’ performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training. Interestingly, even when Large Language Models like CodeLlama and StarCoder2 are used for code generation, the Pass@K ( (K=1,5,10) ) results lags signigicantly behind Python scores. Our research shows that R as a low resource language requires different techniques to collect a high quality data. Specifically separating the two R styles has a great impact on the results and the separate dataset could increase the performance of the models. Our research sheds light on the capabilities of Code-PLMs and opens new research directions for researchers and practitioners for developing code intelligence tools and techniques for R. With R's widespread use and popularity, the results of our study can potentially benefit a large community of R developers, both in research and industry.},

abstract = {To broaden participation, competitive programming contests may include beginner-level problems that do not require knowledge of advanced Computer Science concepts (e.g., algorithms and data structures). However, since most participants have easy access to AI code-generation tools, these problems often become trivial to solve. For beginner-friendly programming contests that do not prohibit the use of AI tools, we propose Probeable Problems: code writing tasks that provide (1)&nbsp;a problem specification that deliberately omits certain details, and (2)&nbsp;a mechanism to probe for these details by asking clarifying questions and receiving immediate feedback. To evaluate our proposal, we conducted a 2-hour programming contest for undergraduate Computer Science students from multiple institutions, where each student was an active member of their institution’s ACM student chapter. The contest comprised of six Probeable Problems for which a popular code-generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) were unable to generate accurate solutions due to the absence of details. Students were permitted to work individually or in groups, and were free to use AI tools. We obtained consent from 26&nbsp;groups (67&nbsp;students) to use their submissions for research. To determine whether Probeable Problems are suitable for such contests, we analyze the extent to which the code submitted by these groups identifies missing details.},

abstract = {Grasping complex computing concepts often poses a challenge for students who struggle to anchor these new ideas to familiar experiences and understandings. To help with this, a good analogy can bridge the gap between unfamiliar concepts and familiar ones, providing an engaging way to aid understanding. However, creating effective educational analogies is difficult even for experienced instructors. We investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, can provide access to personally relevant analogies on demand. Focusing on recursion, a challenging threshold concept, we conducted an investigation analyzing the analogies generated by more than 350 first-year computing students. They were provided with a code snippet and tasked to generate their own recursion-based analogies using ChatGPT, optionally including personally relevant topics in their prompts. We observed a great deal of diversity in the analogies produced with student-prescribed topics, in contrast to the otherwise generic analogies, highlighting the value of student creativity when working with LLMs. Not only did students enjoy the activity and report an improved understanding of recursion, but they described more easily remembering analogies that were personally and culturally relevant.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a state-of-the-art learning model with a wide range of applications in diverse computing environments. Among the various computational operations that comprise the LLM, the GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation is the most frequently utilized operation within the LLM. GEMM libraries such as cuBLAS and CUTLASS provide a variety of optimization techniques to achieve optimal GEMM performance in GPU-enabled computing environments. In particular, the CUTLASS open-source library for GPUs within the CUDA programming environment provides users with the capability to optimize templates for high performance. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of CUTLASS-based GEMMs in improving the performance of real-world deep neural networks on various deep learning platforms. However, these studies have not considered different model parameters for modern LLMs nor have they explored the impact of diverse GPU computing environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                This paper presents CUrator, an efficient LLM execution engine that can achieve optimal end-to-end LLM performance using both cuBLAS and CUTLASS libraries on different GPUs for modern LLMs such as BERT, GPT, and Llama. CUrator first generates CUTLASS-/cuBLAS-friendly graph IRs of various LLMs on the TVM framework to maximize mapping coverage. On the CUTLASS mapping path, it performs a comprehensive search for programmable tuning parameters in the CUTLASS library with the objective of deriving optimal kernels for all GEMMs within each LLM. CUrator further introduces two optimization techniques: 1) build-time reduction key initialization support for CUTLASS Split-K GEMMs, and 2) Split-K support for CUTLASS Batch GEMMs. Finally, CUrator selects the best performing mapping path between cuBLAS and CUTLASS paths. The experimental results show that CUrator achieves inference speedups of 1.50\texttimes{} and 4.99\texttimes{}, respectively, for representative LLMs on the A100 GPU in the single and half precision, compared to the baseline. We strongly believe that the CUrator framework can provide the best direction for next-generation tuning frameworks by showing the maximum end-to-end performance of various LLMs on various GPUs.},

abstract = {Cheating has been a long-standing issue in university assessments. However, the release of ChatGPT and other free-to-use generative AI tools has provided a new and distinct method for cheating. Students can run many assessment questions through the tool and generate a superficially compelling answer, which may or may not be accurate.&nbsp;We ran a dual-anonymous “quality assurance” marking exercise across four end-of-module assessments across a distance university computer science (CS) curriculum. Each marker received five ChatGPT-generated scripts alongside 10 student scripts. A total of 90 scripts were marked; every ChatGPT-generated script for the undergraduate modules received at least a passing grade (&gt;40%), with all of the introductory module CS1 scripts receiving a distinction (&gt;85%). None of the ChatGPT-taught postgraduate scripts received a passing grade (&gt;50%). We also present the results of interviewing the markers and of running our sample scripts through a GPT-2 detector and the TurnItIn AI detector, which both identified every ChatGPT-generated script but differed in the number of false positives. As such, we contribute a baseline understanding of how the public release of generative AI is likely to significantly impact quality assurance processes. Our analysis demonstrates that in most cases, across a range of question formats, topics, and study levels, ChatGPT is at least capable of producing adequate answers for undergraduate assessment.},

abstract = {Recent research has explored the creation of questions from code submitted by students. These Questions about Learners' Code (QLCs) are created through program analysis, exploring execution paths, and then creating code comprehension questions from these paths and the broader code structure. Responding to the questions requires reading and tracing the code, which is known to support students' learning. At the same time, computing education researchers have witnessed the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have taken the community by storm. Researchers have demonstrated the applicability of these models especially in the introductory programming context, outlining their performance in solving introductory programming problems and their utility in creating new learning resources. In this work, we explore the capability of the state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in answering QLCs that are generated from code that the LLMs have created. Our results show that although the state-of-the-art LLMs can create programs and trace program execution when prompted, they easily succumb to similar errors that have previously been recorded for novice programmers. These results demonstrate the fallibility of these models and perhaps dampen the expectations fueled by the recent LLM hype. At the same time, we also highlight future research possibilities such as using LLMs to mimic students as their behavior can indeed be similar for some specific tasks.},

Distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written text is notoriously difficult. In this study, we applied two text distance algorithms, commonly used for machine translation and document comparisons, to detect similarities between various computer Python code submissions and employed hierarchical clustering to analyze them from both AI tools and human programmers. Our results indicate that the distances to the cluster representatives can effectively predict whether a code submission is generated by AI or by novice programmers, achieving an accuracy of over 90%. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of text distance algorithms in identifying the origin of coding submissions, whether generated by AI or by novice programmers.},

abstract = {A key part of learning to program is learning to understand programming error messages. They can be hard to interpret and identifying the cause of errors can be time-consuming. One factor in this challenge is that the messages are typically intended for an audience that already knows how to program, or even for programming environments that then use the information to highlight areas in code. Researchers have been working on making these errors more novice friendly since the 1960s, however progress has been slow. The present work contributes to this stream of research by using large language models to enhance programming error messages with explanations of the errors and suggestions on how to fix them. Large language models can be used to create useful and novice-friendly enhancements to programming error messages that sometimes surpass the original programming error messages in interpretability and actionability. These results provide further evidence of the benefits of large language models for computing educators, highlighting their use in areas known to be challenging for students. We further discuss the benefits and downsides of large language models and highlight future streams of research for enhancing programming error messages.},

abstract = {Confidential computing on GPUs, like NVIDIA H100, mitigates the security risks of outsourced Large Language Models (LLMs) by implementing strong isolation and data encryption. Nonetheless, this encryption incurs a significant performance overhead, reaching up to 52.8% and 88.2% throughput drop when serving OPT-30B and OPT-66B, respectively. To address this challenge, we introduce PipeLLM, a user-transparent runtime system. PipeLLM removes the overhead by overlapping the encryption and GPU computation through pipelining-an idea inspired by the CPU instruction pipelining-thereby effectively concealing the latency increase caused by encryption. The primary technical challenge is that, unlike CPUs, the encryption module lacks prior knowledge of the specific data needing encryption until it is requested by the GPUs. To this end, we propose speculative pipelined encryption to predict the data requiring encryption by analyzing the serving patterns of LLMs. Further, we have developed an efficient, low-cost pipeline relinquishing approach for instances of incorrect predictions. Our experiments show that compared with vanilla systems without confidential computing (e.g., vLLM, PEFT, and FlexGen), PipeLLM incurs modest overhead ( &lt; 19.6% in throughput) across various LLM sizes, from 13B to 175B.

abstract = {Understanding and identifying the causes behind developers' emotions (e.g., Frustration caused by 'delays in merging pull requests') can be crucial towards finding solutions to problems and fostering collaboration in open-source communities. Effectively identifying such information in the high volume of communications across the different project channels, such as chats, emails, and issue comments, requires automated recognition of emotions and their causes. To enable this automation, large-scale software engineering-specific datasets that can be used to train accurate machine learning models are required. However, such datasets are expensive to create with the variety and informal nature of software projects' communication channels.In this paper, we explore zero-shot LLMs that are pre-trained on massive datasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting emotion causes in software engineering: ChatGPT, GPT-4, and flan-alpaca. Our evaluation indicates that these recently available models can identify emotion categories when given detailed emotions, although they perform worse than the top-rated models. For emotion cause identification, our results indicate that zero-shot LLMs are effective at recognizing the correct emotion cause with a BLEU-2 score of 0.598. To highlight the potential use of these techniques, we conduct a case study of the causes of Frustration in the last year of development of a popular open-source project, revealing several interesting insights.},

abstract = {Handling long tail corner cases is a major challenge faced by autonomous vehicles (AVs). While large language models (LLMs) hold great potentials to handle the corner cases with excellent generalization and explanation capabilities and received increasing research interest on application to autonomous driving, there are still technical barriers to be tackled, such as strict model performance and huge computing resource requirements of LLMs, which are difficult to be met locally at AVs. In this paper, we investigate a new approach of applying remote or edge LLMs to support autonomous driving. With this approach connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) send driving assistance requests to the LLMs. LLMs deployed at the edge of the networks or remote clouds process the requests and generate driving assistance instructions for the CAVs. A key issue for such LLM assisted driving system is the assessment of LLMs on their understanding of driving theory and skills, ensuring they are qualified to undertake safety critical driving assistance tasks for CAVs. As there is no published work on assessing LLM of driving theory and skills, we design and run driving theory tests for several proprietary LLM models (OpenAI GPT models, Baidu Ernie and Ali QWen) and open-source LLM models (Tsinghua MiniCPM-2B and MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5) with more than 500 multiple-choices theory test questions. These questions are close to the official UK driving theory test ones. Model accuracy, cost and processing latency are measured from the experiments. Experiment results show that while model GPT-4 passes the test with improved domain knowledge and Ernie has an accuracy of 85% (just below the 86% passing threshold), other LLM models including GPT-3.5 fail the test. For the test questions with images, the multimodal model GPT4-o has an excellent accuracy result of 96%, and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5 achieves an accuracy of 76%. While GPT-4 holds stronger potential for CAV driving assistance applications, the cost of using model GPT4 is much higher, almost 50 times of that of using GPT3.5. The results can help make decision on the use of the existing LLMs for CAV applications and balancing on the model performance and cost.},

abstract = {The efficient execution of attention-based transformers and large language models on traditional CPUs and GPUs presents significant challenges related to performance and energy efficiency. While innovative solutions like ASICs, FPGAs, and ReRAMs have been explored, the field of silicon photonics has emerged as a promising avenue for developing energy-efficient accelerators for deep AI models. Notably, existing endeavors in silicon photonics have predominantly concentrated on inference for deep AI algorithms, leaving a limited number of initiatives focused on creating comprehensive deep learning accelerators capable of real-time training for transformer-like algorithms. This paper utilizes the superior merits of silicon photonics to realize a full-fledged transformer accelerator equipped for both inference and training. Introducing PHOTRAN, an AI analog photonics accelerator, we harness silicon microdisk-based convolution, photonic phase-change memory-based cache, and dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing to achieve energy-efficient and ultrafast transformer acceleration. Through evaluations using a commercial CAD framework on benchmark models, including Vision Transformers and Large Language models, our results showcase the superior performance of PHOTRAN. This work underscores the significant potential of photonic computing for on-chip training of large deep AI models.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial intelligence for teaching and learning in the academic sphere is a trending subject of interest in computing education. ChatGPT, as an AI-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened student involvement, cooperation, accessibility, and availability. This paper addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing ChatGPT as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate Computer Science curriculum in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. Students having completed the course work for a Data Structures and Algorithms (a sophomore-level course) participated in this study. Two groups of students were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. The control group (group A) had access to textbooks and notes of programming courses, however, no Internet access was provided. Group B students were given access to ChatGPT and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using Programming Contest Control (PC2) environment which is widely used in ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of students addresses the problem by writing executable code that satisfies a certain number of test cases. Student teams were scored based on their performance in terms of the number of successfully passed test cases. Results show that students using ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however, there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted code consequently affecting the overall performance. After a thorough analysis, the paper’s findings indicate that incorporating AI in higher education brings about various opportunities and challenges. Nonetheless, universities can efficiently manage these apprehensions by adopting a proactive and ethical stance toward the implementation of such tools.},

In our work, we seek to investigate the capabilities of these models in visual programming domains popularly used for K-8 programming education, including domains like Scratch&nbsp;[17], Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5], and Karel&nbsp;[13]. Recent works have shown us sparks of advanced capabilities of such models for various education scenarios in introductory Python programming&nbsp;[2, 14, 18, 20]. In fact, a study in 2022 had ranked Codex in the top quartile w.r.t students in a large Python programming course&nbsp;[8]. However, all these works consider only text-based Python programming and leave open the question of how well these models would perform for visual programming. The main research question is: Do state-of-the-art neural generative models show advanced capabilities for visual programming on par with their capabilities on text-based Python programming?In our work, we evaluate these models for visual programming based on the following three settings designed to capture various generative and problem-solving capabilities: We conduct our evaluation based on 10 representative tasks from two visual programming domains: Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5] and Intro to Programming with Karel course by CodeHS.com&nbsp;[3, 13]. As illustrative examples, Figures&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 show the output of GPT-4 in three settings for Maze18 task. We will provide the detailed analysis and prompts used in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results for ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 show that these models perform poorly and produce incorrect output the majority of the time. These results highlight that state-of-the-art neural generative models like GPT-4 still struggle to combine spatial, logical, and programming skills crucial for visual programming. As the next step, it would be important to curate novel benchmarks that the research community can use to evaluate improvements in future versions of these models for visual programming.},

abstract = {To recognize the current and future trends and challenges in computer science education educational materials for the next decade, the authors of this work provide a conversation to voice the computer science community's experience and expertise on these trends. One of the biggest challenges for introductory computing courses in the next few years will be leveraging the new capabilities of Artificial Intelligent systems such as Open AI CodeX and GPT3 that can generate code from a textual description, explain code, and translate code between programming languages. These tools could drastically change how introductory programming is taught by allowing students to focus more on understanding code, modifying code, and testing code than on writing code. Learning content is increasingly shifting from paper textbooks to online learning systems, which include not just traditional text and figures, but increasingly use interactive items to provide students with better explanations and illustrations, extensive practice, and frequent immediate formative feedback, typically at a lower cognitive load than classical programming assignment. We will discuss challenges and opportunities for interoperability with publishing and learning management platforms. Another example is how guided-based instruments, such as peer team learning, open educational resources, or workbooks, are adaptive and hybrid according to students' needs.Feedback and point of view from the CS community will be considered as part of the curricular practices "Future of CS educational materials" document, featured in the new version of the CS2023: ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI Computer Science Curricula.},

abstract = {Recent prolific advances in artificial intelligence through the incorporation of domain knowledge have constituted a new paradigm for AI and data mining communities. For example, the human feedback-based language generation in ChatGPT (a large language model (LLM)), the use of Protein Bank in DeepMind's AlphaFold, and the use of 23 rules of safety in DeepMind's Sparrow have demonstrated the success of teaming human knowledge and AI. In addition, the knowledge retrieval-guided language modeling methods have strengthened the association between knowledge and AI. However, translating research methods and resources into practice presents a new challenge for the machine learning and data/knowledge mining communities. For example, in DARPA's Explainable AI seminar, the need for explainable contextual adaptation is seen as the 3rd phase of AI, facilitating the interplay between data and knowledge for explainability, safety, and, eventually, trust. However, policymakers and practitioners assert serious usability and privacy concerns that constrain adoption, notably in high-consequence domains, such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and other social good domains. In addition, limitations in output quality, measurement, and interactive ability, including both the provision of explanations and the acceptance of user preferences, result in low adoption rates in such domains. This workshop aims to accelerate our pace towards creating innovative methods for integrating knowledge into contemporary AI and data science methods and develop metrics for assessing performance in various applications.},

abstract = {This paper introduces AEKG4APT, an APT Knowledge Graph (KG) enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs), as a way to deal with the cybersecurity problems caused by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The core of AEKG4APT lies in the combined application of LLMs, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and KG. The first part of the paper goes into great detail about how the AEKG4APT was constructed, including its ontology schema, data sources, and dataset features. There are also statistics on the AEKG4APT’s nodes, relationships, and key attributes. Secondly, it was shown how to utilize LLMs and public sandboxes for the collection and analysis of CTI Additionally, tests that compare traditional deep learning models to LLM methods show that LLM is both more efficient and more accurate at extracting information. Subsequently, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory - Interpretive Structural Modeling (DEMATEL-ISM) analytical method was introduced to identify and analyse the factors and their interrelationships within the AEKG4APT data, thereby revealing the key dependencies and influence paths within the data structure. Experiments were designed to demonstrate its applications in modeling, computing, and obtaining interpretable computational results on AEKG4APT. In addition, this paper also explores the dynamic expansion capabilities of AEKG4APT, including data expansion, schema expansion, and permanent maintenance strategies, to address the evolving APT threats. Finally, this paper summarizes the competitiveness and application value of AEKG4APT by comparing it with other CTI KGs and platforms in academia and industry, demonstrating its extensive application potential in the field of cybersecurity.},

abstract = {Homomorphic encryption is one of the main solutions for building secure and privacy-preserving solutions for Machine Learning as a Service, a major challenge in a society where AI becomes more and more pervasive. This motivates the development of homomorphic algorithms for the main building blocks of AI, typically for the components of the various types of neural networks architectures.Among those components, we focus on the Softmax function, defined by Softmax(x ) = (exp(xi) / ∑j=1n exp(xj))1 ≤ i ≤ n. This function is deemed to be one of the most difficult to evaluate homomorphically, because of its multivariate nature and of the very large range of values for exp(xi). The available homomorphic algorithms remain restricted, especially in large dimensions, while important applications such as Large Language Models (LLM) require computing Softmax over large dimensional vectors. Our algorithm has strong scalability properties in terms of range and dimension while maintaining very good numerical accuracy. In terms of multiplicative depth of the computation (a suitable measure of cost for homomorphic algorithms), our algorithm achieves O(log n) complexity for a fixed range of inputs, where n is the Softmax dimension.Our algorithm is especially adapted to the situation where we must compute many Softmax at the same time, for instance, in the LLM situation. In that case, assuming that all Softmax calls are packed into m ciphtertexts, the asymptotic amortized multiplicative depth cost per ciphertext is, again over a fixed range, O(1 + m/N) for N the homomorphic ring degree (typically N=216, so that we have N ≫ m in practice).The main ingredient of our algorithms is a normalize-and-square strategy, which manages to interlace the (numerically unstable) exponential computation over a large range and (very expensive) normalization, decomposing both in stabler and cheaper smaller steps.We have implemented our algorithms using the HEaaN implementation of the CKKS HE system. Comparing ourselves to the state of the art, our experiments show, in practice, a gain of a factor 2.5 to 8 compared to state of the art solutions.These experiments demonstrate good accuracy (around 16-bit precision in the worst case, around 20 on average) and support the linear behavior in the dimension. The many-ciphertexts version allows us to compute 8192 Softmax of dimension 256 in parallel in 486s (single-thread CPU), corresponding to an amortized 0.06s per Softmax call. All Softmax calls of the 32-layers LLaMa large language model (7B version) with context length 128 on an RTX-6000 GPU take around 1.5 minutes, and the final Softmax call in dimension 32768 for token generation takes less than 3 seconds. This suggests that near-practicality may be accessible with dedicated hardware.},

abstract = {Spatial Computing involves interacting with the physical world through spatial data manipulation, closely linked with Extended Reality (XR), which includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance XR applications by improving user interactions through natural language understanding and content generation. Typical evaluations of these applications focus on user experience (UX) metrics, such as task performance, user satisfaction, and psychological assessments, but often neglect the technical performance of the LLMs themselves. This paper identifies significant gaps in current evaluation practices for LLMs within XR environments, attributing them to the novelty of the field, the complexity of spatial contexts, and the multimodal nature of interactions in XR. To address these gaps, the paper proposes specific metrics tailored to evaluate LLM performance in XR contexts, including spatial contextual awareness, coherence, proactivity, multimodal integration, hallucination, and question-answering accuracy. These proposed metrics aim to complement existing UX evaluations, providing a comprehensive assessment framework that captures both the technical and user-centric aspects of LLM performance in XR applications. The conclusion underscores the necessity for a dual-focused approach that combines technical and UX metrics to ensure effective and user-friendly LLM-integrated XR systems.},

abstract = {Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior – in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students (n = 964) solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming.},

abstract = {Opinion mining for app reviews aims to analyze user comments on app stores to support software engineering activities, primarily software maintenance and evolution. One of the main challenges in maintaining software quality is promptly identifying emerging issues, such as bugs. However, manually analyzing these comments is challenging due to the large amount of textual data. Methods based on machine learning have been employed to automate opinion mining and address this issue. Gap. While recent methods have achieved promising results in extracting and categorizing issues from users’ opinions, existing studies mainly focus on assisting software engineers in exploring users’ historical behavior regarding app functionalities and do not explore mechanisms for trend detection and risk classification of emerging issues. Furthermore, these studies do not cover the entire issue analysis process through an unsupervised approach. Contribution. This work advances state of the art in opinion mining for app reviews by proposing an entire automated issue analysis approach to identify, prioritize, and monitor the risk of emerging issues. Our proposal introduces a two-fold approach that (i) identifies possible defective software requirements and trains predictive models for anticipating requirements with a higher probability of negative evaluation and (ii) detect issues in reviews, classifies them in a risk matrix with prioritization levels, and monitors their evolution over time. Additionally, we present a risk matrix construction approach from app reviews using the recent Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an analytical data exploration tool that allows engineers to browse the risk matrix, time series, heat map, issue tree, alerts, and notifications. Our goal is to minimize the time between the occurrence of an issue and its correction, enabling the quick identification of problems. Results. We processed over 6.6 million reviews across 20 domains to evaluate our proposal, identifying and ranking the risks associated with nearly 270,000 issues. The results demonstrate the competitiveness of our unsupervised approach compared to existing supervised models. Conclusions. We have proven that opinions extracted from user reviews provide crucial insights into app issues and risks and can be identified early to mitigate their impact. Our opinion mining process implements an entire automated issue analysis with risk-based prioritization and temporal monitoring.},

Many faculty readily acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity in the Computer Science curriculum, but there are still barriers to integrating it into existing courses. One of those barriers is the fact that in most courses, the current content fills the entire term. Another issues is that faculty don't have time and expertise to create new content that would fit well with their current content and style. The third problem is that exercises created should be resistant to solution by LLMs. We have developed cybersecurity exercises that combine two principles: environment specificity and polymorphism. Environment specificity means that the solutions to the exercise should depend on the local environment (LLMs don't have access to that information). In this context, polymorphism means that they can be easily modified each time that the class is taught.},

To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

With their ability to process vast amounts of data, grasp contextual nuances, and engage in human-like dialogue, LLMs present new opportunities and challenges for understanding online interactions. The SocialLLM 2025 workshop builds on the foundation laid by SocialNLP, expanding the scope to explore the capabilities and implications of LLMs in social media research. This year's workshop at TheWebConf 2025 focuses on three pivotal themes: leveraging LLMs for mental health support, enhancing emotion detection in textual interactions, and improving misinformation detection through active learning. The selected papers illustrate cutting-edge advancements in these areas, demonstrating how LLMs can be fine-tuned for therapeutic dialogue generation, assessed for their emotional intelligence, and optimized for misinformation detection with minimal labeled data. These contributions highlight the growing interdisciplinary nature of LLM research, merging insights from natural language processing, social computing, and artificial intelligence ethics. By bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, SocialLLM 2025 aims to foster meaningful discussions on the opportunities and risks associated with LLM-driven social media applications. The workshop serves as a platform for exploring novel methodologies, addressing ethical concerns, and shaping future directions for responsible AI deployment in social media environments. Through collaborative efforts, we seek to advance the field and ensure that LLMs contribute positively to the digital ecosystem.},

abstract = {1 A rather strange introductionI confess, I am a voracious book reader, and being (luckily) versed in quite a few tongues, I enjoy reading books frequently (but not always) without needing translation. In fact, I find languages fascinating, for all they say about people's culture, history, and traits.As a student in Computer Science in the late 1980s, I was imbued with Noam Chomsky's linguistic ''generative grammar'' theory. That theory sees specific languages as second-order derivatives of a single universal grammar, innate in the human mind. That theory, with its hierarchy of formal grammars, has laid the foundation for the theory and practice of language compilers. The principal tenet of Chomsky's theory is that grammar precedes language.},

abstract = {Worked examples, which illustrate the process for solving a problem step-by-step, are a well-established pedagogical technique that has been widely studied in computing classrooms. However, creating high-quality worked examples is very time-intensive for educators, and thus learners tend not to have access to a broad range of such examples. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), which appear capable of generating high-quality human-like content, may offer a solution. Separate strands of recent work have shown that LLMs can accurately generate code suitable for a novice audience, and that they can generate high-quality explanations of code. Therefore, LLMs may be well suited to creating a broad range of worked examples, overcoming the bottleneck of manual effort that is currently required. In this work, we present a novel tool, ‘WorkedGen’, which uses an LLM to generate interactive worked examples. We evaluate this tool with both an expert assessment of the content, and a user study involving students in a first-year Python programming course (n = ~400). We find that prompt chaining and one-shot learning are useful strategies for optimising the output of an LLM when producing worked examples. Our expert analysis suggests that LLMs generate clear explanations, and our classroom deployment revealed that students find the LLM-generated worked examples useful for their learning. We propose several avenues for future work, including investigating WorkedGen’s value in a range of programming languages, and with more complex questions suitable for more advanced courses.},

abstract = {Background. Concurrent and parallel programming is difficult to teach and learn as the understanding of complex and abstract concepts such as nondeterminism, semaphore, and rare conditions, among others, is required [1, 2, 9], having as a core issue the synchronisation of processes to achieve a common goal [4]. It is well-acknowledged that concurrent and parallel programming skills are fundamental since, nowadays, computing is increasingly handled in a parallel manner [7].Problem and Motivation. Therefore, identifying students’ pitfalls and successes when solving practical concurrent and parallel programming exercises could shed light on the best approaches and strategies that they use [3]. In addition, the advent of large language models, and generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, has prompted intensive research on their use in several areas including programming teaching and learning [8]. Yet, the studies in the literature have focused on issues related to learning to program by novice students in introductory courses (e.g., CS1, CS2) [6]. Less work, however, has been presented on the impact of generative AI tools in advanced programming practices such as concurrent and parallel programming.Methodology. To investigate whether generative AI has had an impact on the submitted concurrent and parallel programming exercises solutions at the University of Aizu, Japan, we performed a comparison analysis of the students’ submissions over 2020–2023. The analysis included five different exercises covering the basis of concurrency through various tasks and scenarios where the implementation of parallel processes is needed as solution. For instance, exercises 2.3 and 2.4 required to create parallel processes and perform independent computations; exercises 3.2 and 3.3, required synchronisation of the parallel processes; and in exercise 3.5 a code template was given for modification. We analysed the submissions of 72 undergraduate 3rd year students (avg. 18 students/year) and labelled the solutions using the following nomenclature: OK, indicating a good solution; OKFeat, a good solution but with unusual features; AdvLib, use of unnecessary advanced library or functionality; BadTool, use of an inappropriate tool when the task definition explicitly required a different tool; CodeErr, general coding error; SyncErr, concurrent programming specific error; N/A, solution not submitted or incomplete.Results and Analysis. Results show a substantial increase in the incidence of use of advance libraries (AdvLib) and the wrong tools (BadTool) among students in 2023 for three out of the five analysed exercises. At the same time the concurrency programming-specific errors (SyncErr) also see a reduction in all the exercises. (Figure 1). This coincides with the availability of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT [5], which warrants further investigations to understand how students, teachers and instructors could harness the affordances of large language models in their concurrent programming learning, teaching, and practice.Contribution and Impact. This paper presents an initial step towards investigating the impact of generative AI on advanced programming topics. This research will continue to uncover strategies for the lecturers and instructors to identify the affordances and use of generative AI and to design exercises that harness these affordances to support students learning of difficult programming concepts.},

[4] in 2021, maps into the DHS/NSA KUs supporting the CAE-CD designation, from two aspects: E-voting principle based topics, i.e., from theory and a plug-and-play e-voting system's composing components, i.e., from practice. We grouped CAE-CD KUs into those required as prerequisites, closely related, related/supported, and not covered by the E-voting curriculum. Teachers can then choose which KUs they will use and teach using only the parts of the E-voting-oriented curriculum they deem relevant, and in a depth they find appropriate to their educational objectives, while meeting the requirements of the selected KUs. We conclude with a discussion of how LLMs (Large Language Models) and quantum computing might be added to the E-voting-oriented curriculum.},

abstract = {Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling for knowledge graphs building, the workshop targets communities focusing on the analysis of online discourse, relying on methods from machine learning, natural language processing, large language models and Web data mining.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently achieved impressive success across a wide range of real-world vision and language processing tasks, spanning from image classification to many other downstream vision tasks, such as object detection, tracking, and segmentation. However, previous well-established DNNs, despite being able to maintain superior accuracy, have also been evolving to be deeper and wider and thus inevitably necessitate prohibitive computational resources for both training and inference. This trend further enlarges the computational gap between computation-intensive DNNs and resource-constrained embedded computing systems, making it challenging to deploy powerful DNNs in real-world embedded computing systems towards ubiquitous embedded intelligence. To alleviate this computational gap and enable ubiquitous embedded intelligence, we focus in this survey on discussing recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems, spanning from training to inference, from manual to automated, from convolutional neural networks to transformers, from transformers to vision transformers, from vision models to large language models, from software to hardware, and from algorithms to applications. Specifically, we discuss recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems from the lens of (1) efficient manual network design for embedded computing systems, (2) efficient automated network design for embedded computing systems, (3) efficient network compression for embedded computing systems, (4) efficient on-device learning for embedded computing systems, (5) efficient large language models for embedded computing systems, (6) efficient deep learning software and hardware for embedded computing systems, and (7) efficient intelligent applications for embedded computing systems. We also envision promising future directions and trends, which have the potential to deliver more ubiquitous embedded intelligence. We believe this survey has its merits and can shed light on future research, which can largely help researchers to quickly and smoothly get started in this emerging field.},

The sample was made up of students enrolled in the IX and X semester of the aforementioned professional career. Through univariate correlation analysis and applying Spearman's Rho test (0.587&gt;0.344, p&lt;0.05), a significant correlation between the variables is confirmed, highlighting the importance of the self-directed approach in the training of educators supported in the use from chatGPT. Additionally, specific strategies, such as outreach, collaboration, conceptualization, planning, test preparation, and participation, were found to be related to preprofessional practice success. Consequently, it is recommended to actively promote heutagogical learning and the application of these strategies in the training of educators.},

These surveys, as well as other types of evaluations, often invite students to provide open-ended feedback about their experiences. However, analyzing these comments can prove to be a challenge, especially to CS educators who may not have strong expertise in qualitative research methods. In addition, in a large study, evaluating all of the provided comments can consume a significant amount of researcher time. In this work, we undertook two separate conversations with ChatGPT in which we prompted it to perform qualitative analysis of a set of comments collected in an earlier study. This allowed us to begin to judge how effectively a modern large language model can serve as an assistant in qualitative analysis. We found that with the prompts we used, ChatGPT can reliably build a set of reasonable labels (codes) for a set of comments, but the application of its labels to specific comments may or may not be effective and human researchers still need to use care and their own understanding in interpreting its output.},

abstract = {Having spent the past year post-retirement working with my alma mater, New Mexico State University's (NMSU) Computer Science department to broaden computing, increase student engagement, and to improve graduation completion, as well as reflecting on the state of computing in society at large, I thought I'd share some observations. In March of this year, I had the opportunity to participate in the SIGCSE 2022 Technical Symposium. I was struck by Dr. Shaundra Daily's plenary keynote, entitled "Diversifying Computing: Real Change Must Come from Within", and her use of the phrase "navigating systems that were not designed for me" as she described her exploration of STEM as a first-generation college student, as both a dance and an engineering student, and as a graduate student preparing for motherhood lacking flexibility during her pregnancy, no maternity leave, no livable stipend, and a lack of affordable childcare, as well as the coping strategies she needed to develop to deal with academic culture. In my work with NMSU this past spring, co-teaching a problem solving course, my work this fall advising CS students, and my board roles serving on the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Roundtable for Systemic Change in Undergraduate STEM Education co-chairing the "Culture of STEM" workgroup, on the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institution's (CAHSI) Advisory Board, and on the Computing Research Association for Widening Participation (CRA-WP), co-editing the "Expanding the Pipeline" column, it's clear that system design adversely impacts society in terms of determining not only who gets to participate in the design of computer hardware and software, but also who gets to advance in social and economic mobility. Academic institutions are complex systems in need of an overhaul, by the University of California's academic workers strike for better pay and benefits. The design and commercialization of AI without fully understanding the implications of bias and ethics is inherently a system design problem. The application to everything from AI generated art and images (and how to spot deep fakes), the ability of large language models (LLMs) to create volumes of text generated articles that appear legitimate with the capacity to spread hate and misinformation globally are but just a few examples of the potentially horrific impact to society, because humans cannot work at the pace and scale to validate and/or authenticate them, with few if any meaningful domestic and international laws or policies in place to safeguard us.},

Students are expected to translate programming concepts learned from lectures into executable implementations that solve the tasks outlined in the assignments. These implementations are primarily assessed based on their functional correctness, ensuring that students' code produces the expected output when provided with specific inputs.However, functional correctness is not the only metric that evaluates the quality of programs. Runtime efficiency is a metric that is less frequently evaluated in programming courses, yet it holds significant importance in the context of professional software development. To investigate this gap and its potential ramifications, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the time efficiency of 250 programming assignments that are evaluated solely on functional correctness. The results demonstrate that students' programming assignments exhibit significant variance in terms of execution time. We further identified 27 recurring inefficient code patterns from these assignments, and observed that most of the inefficient patterns can be optimized by automated tools such as PMD, IntelliJ IDEA and ChatGPT. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for educators to enhance the organization and integration of code performance topics throughout the programming course curriculum.},

By examining students' direct responses to error messages, and their behavior throughout the course, we quantitatively evaluate the immediate and longer term efficacy of different error message types. We find that students using GPT generated error messages repeat an error 23.1% less often in the subsequent attempt, and resolve an error in 34.8% fewer additional attempts, compared to students using standard error messages. We also perform an analysis across various demographics to understand any disparities in the impact of different error message types. Our results find no significant difference in the effectiveness of GPT generated error messages for students from varying socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Our findings underscore GPT generated error messages as the most helpful error message type, especially as a universally effective intervention across demographics.},

To address this gap, we introduce a novel food computing foundation model that achieves true multimodality, encompassing tasks such as t2t, t2i, i2t, it2t, and t2ti. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, our model can perform a diverse array of food computing-related tasks, including food understanding, food recognition, recipe generation, and food image generation. Compared to previous models, our foundation model demonstrates a significantly broader range of capabilities and exhibits superior performance, particularly in food image generation and recipe generation tasks.

Additionally, instructors can validate programming problems by running them against an auto-generated solution, allowing them to refine the problems before releasing it to students, preventing misinformation or ambiguity. Students can complete lessons and solve programming problems in a browser-based text editor receiving immediate feedback. They can also interact with a large language model-powered AI chatbot that scaffolds a student on how to approach the problem without giving out solutions. Edugator is built using modern web frameworks and the goal of the tool is to accelerate the adoption of automated assessment tools by minimizing the challenges instructors face with such tools. It also supports Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), allowing seamless integration with learning management systems (LMS). The demo will provide an overview of Edugator's features, including authoring programming problems and lessons using AI or remixing existing problems obtained from test banks, LTI integration, and AI-chatbot.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily lives leads to an increasing demand for AI in learning, teaching, and education. Recent developments, such as ChatGPT, have further pushed the significance of AI, garnering media attention and prompting politicians to require stakeholders in education to place a stronger emphasis on AI education in schools. As a result, a growing number of computer science (CS) curricula are expanding to include the topic of AI. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of AI in K-10 education in Germany by analyzing CS curricula for lower secondary school education across the 16 federal states of Germany. The results indicate that AI-related content is inconsistently addressed in the CS curricula of various federal states, with a noticeable absence of standardized AI competencies for K-10 education. In several federal states, AI-related content is only implicitly addressed from a socio-cultural perspective. To ensure up-to-date education, it is essential to include mandatory AI content in K-10 CS curricula. These contents should be considered holistically by taking into account the technological, socio-cultural, and user-oriented perspectives, in accordance with the Dagstuhl Triangle.},

abstract = {Introduction: The emergence and widespread adoption of generative AI (GenAI) chatbots such as ChatGPT, and programming assistants such as GitHub Copilot, have radically redefined the landscape of programming education. This calls for replication of studies and reexamination of findings from pre-GenAI CS contexts to understand the impact on students. Objectives: Achievement Goals are well studied in computing education and can be predictive of student interest and exam performance. The objective in this study is to compare findings from prior achievement goal studies in CS1 courses with new CS1 courses that emphasize the use of human-GenAI collaborative coding. Methods: In a CS1 course that integrates GenAI, we use linear regression to explore the relationship between achievement goals and prior experience on student interest, exam performance, and perceptions of GenAI. Results: As with prior findings in traditional CS1 classes, Mastery goals are correlated with interest in computing. Contradicting prior CS1 findings, normative goals are correlated with exam scores. Normative and mastery goals correlate with students’ perceptions of learning with GenAI. Mastery goals weakly correlate with reading and testing code output from GenAI.},

We find that a naive application of in-context learning struggles on this problem, in particular with imperfect information. To address this, we introduce GameInterpreter, a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.},

abstract = {Reasoning about code and explaining its purpose are fundamental skills for computer scientists. There has been extensive research in the field of computing education on the relationship between a student's ability to explain code and other skills such as writing and tracing code. In particular, the ability to describe at a high-level of abstraction how code will behave over all possible inputs correlates strongly with code writing skills. However, developing the expertise to comprehend and explain code accurately and succinctly is a challenge for many students. Existing pedagogical approaches that scaffold the ability to explain code, such as producing exemplar code explanations on demand, do not currently scale well to large classrooms. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) may offer a solution. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in generating explanations that can serve as examples to scaffold students' ability to understand and explain code. To evaluate LLM-created explanations, we compare them with explanations created by students in a large course (n ≈ 1000) with respect to accuracy, understandability and length. We find that LLM-created explanations, which can be produced automatically on demand, are rated as being significantly easier to understand and more accurate summaries of code than student-created explanations. We discuss the significance of this finding, and suggest how such models can be incorporated into introductory programming education.},

abstract = {While GPU-based placers have demonstrated significant speed advantages over their CPU-based counterparts, hyperparameter tuning remains a bottleneck, often requiring substantial human intervention and expert knowledge. This challenge is particularly critical given the urgent need for rapid time-to-market solutions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in zero-shot learning, context understanding, logical reasoning, and answer generation. In this work, we introduce HyperPlace, an innovative paradigm that leverages an off-the-shelf LLM to automate hyperparameter optimization using in-context learning techniques. Our approach transcends single-output black-box optimization methods by incorporating a batch optimization mechanism that evaluates multiple hyperparameter configurations simultaneously across several GPU computing platforms. We validated the effectiveness of our approach in placement quality, measured by Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL), using DREAMPlace 2.0. To further demonstrate the capability of integrating our framework with other placers, we conducted additional experiments using Xplace 2.0. By employing the ISPD2005 benchmarks for our evaluation, HyperPlace enhances the placement tools with up to a 1.66% reduction in HPWL compared to their published results. Additionally, we evaluated HyperPlace on the ISPD2015 benchmarks, which incorporate fence region constraints not present in ISPD2005 benchmarks. Under these more complex constraints, HyperPlace achieves up to a 22.24% reduction in HPWL compared to the default settings of the placement tools, further demonstrating its adaptability across diverse placement scenarios and benchmark suites.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on edge devices learn through fine-tuning and updating a certain portion of their parameters. Although such learning methods can be optimized to reduce resource utilization, the overall required resources remain a heavy burden on edge devices. Instead, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a resource-efficient LLM learning method, can improve the quality of the LLM-generated content without updating model parameters. However, the RAG-based LLM may involve repetitive searches on the profile data in every user-LLM interaction. This search can lead to significant latency along with the accumulation of user data. Conventional efforts to decrease latency result in restricting the size of saved user data, thus reducing the scalability of RAG as user data continuously grows. It remains an open question: how to free RAG from the constraints of latency and scalability on edge devices? In this paper, we propose a novel framework to accelerate RAG via Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures. It accelerates matrix multiplications by performing in-situ computation inside the memory while avoiding the expensive data transfer between the computing unit and memory. Our framework, Robust CiM-backed RAG (RoCR), utilizing a novel contrastive learning-based training method and noise-aware training, can enable RAG to efficiently search profile data with CiM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing CiM to accelerate RAG.},

abstract = {Vectorization is a powerful optimization technique that significantly boosts the performance of high performance computing applications operating on large data arrays. Despite decades of research on auto-vectorization, compilers frequently miss opportunities to vectorize code. On the other hand, writing vectorized code manually using compiler intrinsics is still a complex, error-prone task that demands deep knowledge of specific architecture and compilers.  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of large-language models (LLMs) to generate vectorized (Single Instruction Multiple Data) code from scalar programs that process individual array elements.   We propose a novel finite-state-machine multi-agents based approach that harnesses LLMs and test-based feedback to generate vectorized code.  Our findings indicate that LLMs are capable of producing high-performance vectorized code with run-time speedup ranging from 1.1x to 9.4x as compared to the state-of-the-art compilers such as Intel Compiler, GCC, and Clang.  To verify the correctness of vectorized code, we use Alive2, a leading bounded translation validation tool for LLVM IR. We describe a few domain-specific techniques to improve the scalability of Alive2 on our benchmark dataset. Overall, our approach is able to verify 38.2% of vectorizations as correct on the TSVC benchmark dataset.},

This paper introduces Iris, a chat-based virtual tutor integrated into the interactive learning platform Artemis that offers personalized, context-aware assistance in large-scale educational settings. Iris supports computer science students by guiding them through programming exercises and is designed to act as a tutor in a didactically meaningful way. Its calibrated assistance avoids revealing complete solutions, offering subtle hints or counter-questions to foster independent problem-solving skills. For each question, it issues multiple prompts in a Chain-of-Thought to GPT-3.5-Turbo. The prompts include a tutor role description and examples of meaningful answers through few-shot learning. Iris employs contextual awareness by accessing the problem statement, student code, and automated feedback to provide tailored advice. An empirical evaluation shows that students perceive Iris as effective because it understands their questions, provides relevant support, and contributes to the learning process. While students consider Iris a valuable tool for programming exercises and homework, they also feel confident solving programming tasks in computer-based exams without Iris. The findings underscore students' appreciation for Iris' immediate and personalized support, though students predominantly view it as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, human tutors. Nevertheless, Iris creates a space for students to ask questions without being judged by others.},

abstract = {StandUp Reports play an important role in capstone software engineering courses, facilitating progress tracking, obstacle identification, and team collaboration. However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.},

abstract = {This poster explores the potential of ChatGPT to replace the traditional approach of pair programming in introductory computer science courses. Traditionally, two students collaborate as a driver and a navigator, periodically switching roles. Now, a student can pair up with ChatGPT, which offers an innovative approach to pair programming. This exploratory activity, which emphasizes collaboration and communication, provides step-by-step instructions for effectively interacting with ChatGPT during pair programming.This poster reflects on the advantages and limitations of using ChatGPT in pair programming. The main advantages of using ChatGPT include rapid responses, syntax error-free code generation, and flexibility in handling incomplete pseudocode. The primary limitations include the coding generation style, redundancy in responses, and challenges in understanding the code. Despite the advantages, it may still be valuable to have students work with human partners in certain situations, particularly for learning purposes.This poster proposes that ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for enhancing productivity and emphasizes the importance of becoming proficient in its use during students' college years. It also provides insights into the effective utilization of ChatGPT in pair programming and its preparation for future careers in programming and related fields.},

abstract = {The self-attention mechanism distinguishes transformer-based large language models (LLMs) apart from convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Despite the performance improvement, achieving real-time LLM inference on silicon remains challenging due to the extensive use of Softmax in self-attention. In addition to the non-linearity, the low arithmetic intensity significantly limits processing parallelism, especially when working with longer contexts. To address this challenge, we propose Constant Softmax (ConSmax), a software-hardware co-design that serves as an efficient alternative to Softmax. ConSmax utilizes differentiable normalization parameters to eliminate the need for maximum searching and denominator summation in Softmax. This approach enables extensive parallelization while still executing the essential functions of Softmax. Moreover, a scalable ConSmax hardware design with a bitwidth-split look-up table (LUT) can achieve lossless non-linear operations and support mixed-precision computing. Experimental results show that ConSmax achieves a minuscule power consumption of 0.2mW and an area of 0.0008mm2 at 1250MHz working frequency in 16nm FinFET technology. For open-source contribution, we further implement our design with the OpenROAD toolchain under SkyWater's 130nm CMOS technology. The corresponding power is 2.69mW and the area is 0.007mm2. ConSmax achieves 3.35\texttimes{} power savings and 2.75\texttimes{} area savings in 16nm technology, and 3.15\texttimes{} power savings and 4.14\texttimes{} area savings with the open-source EDA toolchain. In the meantime, it also maintains comparable accuracy on the GPT-2 model and the WikiText103 dataset. The project is available at https://github.com/ReaLLMASIC/ConSmax.},

abstract = {Students in introductory computing courses often lack the experience required to effectively identify and resolve errors in their code. For such students, Programming Error Messages (PEMs) are often the first indication of an error, and could provide valuable debugging guidance. However, in many cases, such as with standard C compiler implementations, PEMs are largely unsuitable for novices. Confusing, misleading, and filled with terse language and jargon, these messages instead act as an additional source of difficulty.In this paper, we present DCC Sidekick, which integrates the Debugging C Compiler (DCC) with a Large Language Model (LLM) in a web-based dashboard to produce contextual, accurate guidance conducive to student learning. This dashboard is directly accessible from the output of the compiler, and provides a bird's-eye-view of the program source, compiler output, and a conversational AI interface to help unravel cryptic error messages. We aim to deploy DCC Sidekick to a C-based CS1 cohort at a large higher education institution to investigate how novice students utilise the conversational explanation interface during debugging activities. In this work, we present our experience designing and building DCC Sidekick.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of code generation tools powered by large language models has attracted wide attention. Models such as OpenAI Codex can take natural language problem descriptions as input and generate highly accurate source code solutions, with potentially significant implications for computing education. Given the many complexities that students face when learning to write code, they may quickly become reliant on such tools without properly understanding the underlying concepts. One popular approach for scaffolding the code writing process is to use Parsons problems, which present solution lines of code in a scrambled order. These remove the complexities of low-level syntax, and allow students to focus on algorithmic and design-level problem solving. It is unclear how well code generation models can be applied to solve Parsons problems, given the mechanics of these models and prior evidence that they underperform when problems include specific restrictions. In this paper, we explore the performance of the Codex model for solving Parsons problems over various prompt variations. Using a corpus of Parsons problems we sourced from the computing education literature, we find that Codex successfully reorders the problem blocks about half of the time, a much lower rate of success when compared to prior work on more free-form programming tasks. Regarding prompts, we find that small variations in prompting have a noticeable effect on model performance, although the effect is not as pronounced as between different problems.},

We are witnessing a blossom of LLMs for various fields, especially in multi-modal data research such as vision-language learning, where text modality serves as a supplement for images. As textual modality has rarely been introduced into modality combinations in urban region profiling, we aim to answer two fundamental questions: i) Can text modality enhance urban region profiling? ii) and if so, in what ways and which aspects? To answer the questions, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduce the first-ever LLM-enhanced framework that integrates the knowledge of text modality into urban imagery, named LLM-enhanced Urban Region Profiling with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (UrbanCLIP ). Specifically, it first generates a detailed textual description for each satellite image by Image-to-Text LLMs. Then, the model is trained on image-text pairs, seamlessly unifying language supervision for urban visual representation learning, jointly with contrastive loss and language modeling loss. Results on urban indicator prediction in four major metropolises show its superior performance, with an average improvement of 6.1% on R2 compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

abstract = {As GPUs are widely deployed in High Performance Computing systems, it is critical to ensure that these systems can perform reliably. To improve system reliability, researchers estimate the error resilience of GPU programs by understanding resilience characteristics or modeling error propagation. However, features indicative of resilience rely on manual extraction from simulations of numerous faults, and error propagation analysis cannot target fine-grained bit-level faults. To address those problems, this paper introduces a novel paradigm, namely InstrDGM, for efficiently predicting GPU error resilience. Specifically, InstrDGM first fine-tunes a large language model using extensive sequences of GPU assembly instructions for extracting the semantic representation of instructions automatically. Meanwhile, we consider the propagation of bit-level faults during instruction execution and data transfer processes, and leverage graph neural networks to capture their distinct error propagation patterns. Then, the fault embeddings extracted from these error propagation patterns are integrated for error resilience prediction. Additionally, this paper releases a new dataset for GPU error resilience assessment, containing 1.2 million fault samples. Finally, extensive experiments show that InstrDGM significantly outperforms existing methods.},

abstract = {As robots become increasingly integrated into human life, personalizing human-robot interactions (HRI) is crucial for improving user acceptance, engagement, and interaction quality. However, personalizing HRI poses a unique challenge due to the diversity of human personality traits. This paper proposes a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically tailor robot conversations according to the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits. Our novelty lies in using user personality traits to shape robots' verbal responses and implementing contextual action generation for gestures. This study addresses two primary research questions: (1) Does adapting robots' verbal responses based on user personality traits improve communication satisfaction? (2) How does the addition of context-appropriate gestures further enhance user satisfaction? We used Goldberg's personality trait measurement scale (1992) to assess 26 participants who engaged in conversations with an LLM-powered Pepper robot on various topics. The quality of these interactions was self-reported using a revised version of Hecht's (1978) conversation satisfaction scale. Three experimental conditions were conducted: (i) Baseline: Standard LLM conversation, (ii) Personality-congruent: LLM-adjusted dialogue based on personality of participants, and (iii) Enhanced interaction: Personality adaptation plus dynamic gestures. For the third condition, we implemented contextually appropriate pre-defined animations and generated novel gestures by computing joint angle values in real time. Statistical analysis using ANOVA revealed significant differences in communication satisfaction across the three conditions (F=13.41, p&lt;.001). Post-hoc analyses using \v{S}id\'{a}k's multiple comparison test showed significant pairwise differences: Condition 2 vs. 1: Δ Δmean 4.42 , p = 0.02; Condition 3 vs. 1: Δ Δmean 8.23, p &lt; 0.01; Condition 3 vs. 2: Δ Δmean 3.80, p = 0.05. These results demonstrate that both personality-congruent interactions and non-verbal gestures significantly enhance communication satisfaction, with the combined approach yielding the highest satisfaction. This approach opens new possibilities for developing socially intelligent robots with applications in healthcare, education, and customer service.},

abstract = {Deep learning has shown impressive performance in affective computing, but its black-box characteristic limits the model’s interpretability, posing a challenge to further development and application. Compared with objective recognition tasks such as image recognition, emotion perception as a high-level cognition is more subjective, making it particularly important to enhance the interpretability of deep learning in affective computing. In recent years, some interpretability-related works have emerged, but there are few reviews on this topic yet. This paper summarizes the explainable deep learning methods in affective computing from two aspects: first, the application of general explainable deep learning methods in affective computing from the perspectives of model-agnostic and model-specific is introduced; second, emotion-specific interpretability research that combines emotional psychology theories, physiological studies, and human cognition, covering task design, model design, and result analysis methods, is systematically reviewed. There are new explainable deep learning methods for multimodal and large language models in the context of emotion. Finally, we discuss five specific challenges and propose corresponding future directions to provide insights and references for subsequent research on affective computing interpretability.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-driven Development Environments (AIDEs) offer developers revolutionary computer programming assistance. There is great potential in incorporating AIDEs into Computer Science education; however, the effects of these tools should be fully examined before doing so. Here, a within-subjects study was conducted to compare the programming performance, workload, emotion, and self-efficacy of seventeen novices coding with and without use of the GitHub Copilot AIDE under time pressure. Results showed that using the AIDE significantly increased programming efficiency and reduced effort and mental workload but did not significantly impact emotion or self-efficacy. However, participants' performance improved with more experience using the AI, and their self-efficacy followed. The results suggest that students who try AIDEs will likely be tempted to use them for time-sensitive work. There is no evidence that providing AIDEs will aid struggling students, but there is a clear need for students to practice with AI to become competent and confident using it.},

The emergence of Generative AI offers a novel approach, allowing developers to specify transformations in natural language rather than learning specialized languages. However, our findings suggest that, in its current state, generative AI does not yet pose a threat to dedicated model transformation languages. While AI-assisted approaches promise to provide flexibility and accessibility, dedicated model transformation languages still offer structured advantages crucial for complex transformations, especially when bidirectionality and incrementality are mandatory requirements. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of AI in software engineering, highlighting its potential and current limitations in enhancing model transformation processes.},

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

Yet, it also spotlights concerns over emerging risks. Traditional assessments of risks and benefits have been sporadic, and often require costly expert analysis. We developed a semi-automatic method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify AI uses in mobile and wearables, classify their risks based on the EU AI Act, and determine their benefits that align with globally recognized long-term sustainable development goals; a manual validation of our method by two experts in mobile and wearable technologies, a legal and compliance expert, and a cohort of nine individuals with legal backgrounds who were recruited from Prolific, confirmed its accuracy to be over 85%. We uncovered that specific applications of mobile computing hold significant potential in improving well-being, safety, and social equality. However, these promising uses are linked to risks involving sensitive data, vulnerable groups, and automated decision-making. To avoid rejecting these risky yet impactful mobile and wearable uses, we propose a risk assessment checklist for the Mobile HCI community.},

Three different types of explanations -- a line-by-line explanation, a list of important concepts, and a high-level summary of the code -- were created. Students could view explanations by clicking a button next to code snippets, which showed the explanation and asked about its utility. Our results show that all explanation types were viewed by students and that the majority of students perceived the code explanations as helpful to them. However, student engagement varied by code snippet complexity, explanation type, and code snippet length.

Both are national, government-set / approved, and centrally assessed examinations. We also evaluate performance differences in exams made publicly available before and after the ChatGPT knowledge cutoff date, and investigate what types of question ChatGPT struggles with. We find that ChatGPT is capable of achieving very high marks on both exams and that the performance difference before and after the knowledge cutoff date are minimal. We also observe that ChatGPT struggles with questions involving symbols or images, which can be mitigated when in-text information ‘fills in the gaps’. Additionally, GPT-4 performance can be negatively impacted when an initial inaccurate answer leads to further inaccuracies in subsequent parts of the same question. Finally, the element of choice on the Leaving Certificate is a significant advantage in achieving a high grade. Notably, there are minimal occurrences of hallucinations in answers and few errors in solutions not involving images. These results reveal several strengths and weaknesses of these exams in terms of how generative AI performs on them and have implications for exam design, the construction of marking schemes, and could also shift the focus of what is examined and how.},

To date, several approaches have been put forth for the automatic assignment of labels to issue reports. In particular, supervised approaches based on the fine-tuning of BERT-like language models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance. More recently, decoder-only models such as GPT have become prominent in SE research due to their surprising capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance even for tasks they have not been trained for. To the best of our knowledge, GPT-like models have not been applied yet to the problem of issue classification, despite the promising results achieved for many other software engineering tasks. In this paper, we investigate to what extent we can leverage GPT-like LLMs to automate the issue labeling task. Our results demonstrate the ability of GPT-like models to correctly classify issue reports in the absence of labeled data that would be required to fine-tune BERT-like LLMs.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have demonstrated impressive effectiveness across a wide array of web applications. Notably, graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools for modeling the extensive graph-structured data and text/language data that populate the web. Despite their success, the advancement of these methods is frequently hampered by resource constraints. Key challenges include the scarcity of labeled data (data-level constraints) and the demand for smaller model sizes suitable for real-world computing environments (model-level constraints). Addressing these issues is crucial for the effective and efficient deployment of models across various real-world web systems and applications, such as social networks, search engines, recommender systems, question answering, and content analysis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and efficient learning techniques that can overcome these resource limitations from both data and model perspectives.In this lecture-style tutorial, we will focus on state-of-the-art approaches in resource-efficient learning, specifically exploring a range of data- and model-efficient methods for GNNs and LLMs, along with their practical applications in web contexts. Our objectives for this tutorial are threefold: (1)to categorize challenges in resource-efficient learning and discuss data and model constraints; (2) to provide a comprehensive review of existing methods and recent advances in resource-efficient learning, particularly concerning GNNs and LLMs; and (3) to highlight open questions and potential future research directions in this rapidly evolving field. Together, these objectives will provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of resource-efficient learning for GNNs and LLMs, its challenges, and its potential for future advancements.},

abstract = {With the immense interest in ChatGPT worldwide, education has seen a mix of both excitement and skepticism. To properly evaluate its impact on education, it is crucial to understand how far it can help students without prior knowledge answer assessment questions. This study aims to address this question as well as the impact of the question type. We conducted multiple experiments with computer engineering students (experiment group: n=41 to 56), who were asked to use ChatGPT to answer previous test questions before learning about the related topics. Their scores were then compared with the scores of previous-term students who answered the same questions in a quiz or exam setting (control group: n=24 to 61). The results showed a wide range of effect sizes, from -2.55 to 1.23, depending on the question type and content. The experiment group performed best answering code analysis and conceptual questions but struggled with code completion and questions that involved images. However, the performance in code generation tasks was inconsistent. Overall, the ChatGPT group’s answers lagged slightly behind the control group’s answers with an effect size of -0.16. We conclude that ChatGPT, at least in the field of this study, is not yet ready to rely on by students who do not have sufficient background to evaluate generated answers. We suggest that educators try using ChatGPT and educate students on effective questioning techniques and how to assess the generated responses. This study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.},

abstract = {MoonBit, a new general-purpose programming language designed for cloud and edge computing, was initiated in late 2022, coinciding with the announcement of ChatGPT. Language models like GPT, capable of producing practical programs, are revolutionizing the way we write programs and interact with computers. However, significant challenges persist, such as the models' inability to understand the global context of a whole project with its dependencies, the need for human verification and correction of generated code, and the lack of assurance in meeting basic requirements like syntactic correctness.In this paper, we explore the design of the MoonBit language highlighting its AI integration, emphasizing the synergy between traditional code intelligence and large language model capabilities. We also introduce a real-time, semantics-based sampler to guide the inference process of language models. This approach ensures the generated programs are both syntactically correct and free from obvious semantic flaws, such as type errors. Crucially, this has been achieved with minimal impact on overall performance. Our evaluation demonstrates a notable improvement in code quality, achieved without sacrificing the models' responsiveness.},

abstract = {In response to the recent surge in easily accessible generative AI, Harvey Mudd College has integrated AI-assisted coding into the introductory Computer Science course. In this context, a question arises: How do we measure the quality of students' code when AI-generated code is present?Allowing generative AI to write coding assignments comes with the expectation of improved efficiency and accuracy. While generative AI is a useful tool, it merely supplements fundamental computing skills. This technological step towards being fully syntax-free allows for emphasis on the already important skill of developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills in more abstract contexts. In past years, metrics were designed to measure quantitative aspects of code, but these metrics alone are insufficient when evaluating how code written with the assistance of AI will perform in broader applications. When students submit code written with the assistance of generative AI, they are still expected to meet standards given by past metrics, such as Correctness and Complexity. To establish foundational computing skills, students will also be held to new standards and evaluated by new metrics such as Individuality and Ambition.While the model does give objective measures of the metrics, due to the fast-evolving nature of programming, predefined rules-of-thumb for these metrics are not provided. As users of our system, we recognize that evaluating the measurements will require our judgment, which will evolve over time. This work offers the foundation for that evolution.},

abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models(LLM) and generative AI has led to an explosive increase in computational demands across cloud computing data centers. The growing number of parameters in deep learning models results in significant power consumption problem, leading to the need for cost-effective and eco-friendly data centers. Furthermore, with the advent of multi-cloud environments, deep learning computations, not only for training but also for inference, no longer occur on a single hardware unit but are distributed across various heterogeneous hardware nodes forming clusters. In this paper, we present solutions to these challenges from a parallelism perspective. Considering the characteristics of the models, we implement data parallelism and model parallelism, partitioning models and data across heterogeneous hardware nodes for power-efficient learning and inferencing. To quantify the impact, we measured the power consumption of CPUs, GPUs, and RAM during the experiments, providing insights into the energy efficiency of the proposed partitioning strategies. Furthermore, we conducted a carbon footprint analysis, converting the measured power consumption into equivalent carbon emissions. The study highlights the necessity of partitioning research for energy-efficient learning and inferencing, addressing the identified issues.},

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by restricted and repetitive sensory-motor behaviors and social communication deficits. Though in the recent decade, a rising interest has been demonstrated among the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and broader computing communities in involving multitudes of technologies to support autistic individuals especially children with autism over diverse aspects, the technologies are revealed to often reflect the normative expectations of a neurotypical society and be very one-sided. Thus, autistic children are commonly required to learn the 'appropriate' norm of social interaction defined by neurotypical society. In this work, instead of 'forcing' autistic children to accommodate technology, we propose a self-advocacy chat companion for autistic children based on the Large Language Model (LLM) as an early intervention tool. In the meantime, we hope it could also serve as a source platform that engages neurotypical users (such as parents) in understanding and learning how to interact and communicate with autistic children.},

abstract = {In the contemporary business landscape, organizations often rely on third-party services for many functions, including IT services, cloud computing, and business processes. To identify potential security risks, organizations conduct rigorous assessments before engaging with third-party vendors, referred to as Third-Party Security Risk Management (TPSRM). Traditionally, TPSRM assessments are executed manually by human experts and involve scrutinizing various third-party documents such as System and Organization Controls Type 2 (SOC 2) reports and reviewing comprehensive questionnaires along with the security policy and procedures of vendors—a process that is time-intensive and inherently lacks scalability. 
 
 
 
AgraBOT, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, can assist TPSRM assessors by expediting TPSRM assessments and reducing the time required from days to mere minutes. AgraBOT utilizes cutting-edge AI techniques, including information retrieval (IR), large language models (LLMs), multi-stage ranking, prompt engineering, and in-context learning to accurately generate relevant answers from third-party documents to conduct assessments. We evaluate AgraBOT on seven real TPSRM assessments, consisting of 373 question-answer pairs, and attain an F1 score of 0.85.},

Graph intelligence is rapidly becoming a crucial aspect of understanding and exploiting the intricate interconnections within graph data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and prompt learning techniques have pushed graph intelligence forward, outperforming traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN) pre-training methods and setting new benchmarks for performance. In this tutorial, we begin by offering a comprehensive review and analysis of existing methods that integrate LLMs with graphs. We introduce existing works based on a novel taxonomy that classifies them into three distinct categories according to the roles of LLMs in graph tasks: as enhancers, predictors, or alignment components. Secondly, we introduce a new learning method that utilizes prompting on graphs, offering substantial potential to enhance graph transfer capabilities across diverse tasks and domains. We discuss existing works on graph prompting within a unified framework and introduce our developed tool for executing a variety of graph prompting tasks. Additionally, we discuss the applications of combining Graphs, LLMs, and prompt learning across various tasks, such as urban computing, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.

abstract = {Fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is crucial for the sustained progress of open source development. However, the prevalence of negative discourse, often manifested as toxic comments, poses significant challenges to developer well-being and productivity. To identify such negativity in project communications, especially within large projects, automated toxicity detection models are necessary. To train these models effectively, we need large software engineering-specific toxicity datasets. However, such datasets are limited in availability and often exhibit imbalance (e.g., only 6 in 1000 GitHub issues are toxic) [1], posing challenges for training effective toxicity detection models. To address this problem, we explore a zero-shot LLM (ChatGPT) that is pre-trained on massive datasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting toxicity in software-related text. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that ChatGPT shows promise in detecting toxicity in GitHub, and warrants further investigation. We experimented with various prompts, including those designed for justifying model outputs, thereby enhancing model interpretability and paving the way for potential integration of ChatGPT-enabled toxicity detection into developer communication channels.},

abstract = {The rapid development of Large Language Model (LLM) has brought enormous pressure to power supply and environmental protection. It is necessary to model LLM computing power, electricity, and carbon emissions to analyze energy consumption issues and evaluate the impact of LLM. Previous research on implicit carbon mainly centered around calculation, while attention to operational carbon was mainly focused on LLM training and inference, resulting in incomplete and imprecise calculation of carbon footprint. In order to comprehensively simulate the carbon footprint of LLM throughout its lifecycle, we have created an LLM carbon footprint framework. There are two main contributions: firstly, we propose an algorithm that considers the storage and other components in the embodied carbon, thereby evaluating the embodied carbon emissions generated by all components. Secondly, we calculated the operational carbon in stages based on the LLM process and analyzed in detail the carbon emissions generated in each stage, including data processing, model training, model optimization, model deployment, and model inference, to achieve a refined carbon emission assessment. Finally, we briefly analyzed the current challenges and future development directions based on the model. Our modeling provides a theoretical basis for solving the high energy consumption problem of large-scale models in the future.},

abstract = {Abstract. In the past decade, deep learning based methods have taken a dominant position in natural language processing (NLP). For almost all NLP tasks, deep learning based methods far surpassed traditional methods. Especially in the past five years, the development of deep learning methods has been particularly rapid. For example, the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms represented by BERT have dominated the NLP field, while also driving the development of other fields such as computer vision. Nowadays pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3/ChatGPT further demonstrate the advantages of Transformer based deep learning methods, which can achieve good results across various problems without any specialized training. In spite of the remarkable success, their performances still underperform fine-tuned models in the task of text classification in some scenarios. Nevertheless, the LLMs are good generalist models. The goal we pursue is the deep learning methods with good generalization ability. In the case of limited computing resources and high performance requirements, the fine-tuned models remain the first choice. So how is the generalization ability of the fine-tuned models? In this paper, we explore the generalization of representative Chinese text classification methods based on deep learning. The experimental results indicate that Transformer based methods present good ability of generalization on two significant different Chinese datasets. In the current era of LLMs, this work can assist us in choosing more appropriate solutions for natural language processing tasks.},

ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},

abstract = {Much of the recent work investigating large language models and AI Code Generation tools in computing education has focused on assessing their capabilities for solving typical programming problems and for generating resources such as code explanations and exercises. If progress is to be made toward the inevitable lasting pedagogical change, there is a need for research that explores the instructor voice, seeking to understand how instructors with a range of experiences plan to adapt. In this paper, we report the results of an interview study involving 12 instructors from Australia, Finland and New Zealand, in which we investigate educators' current practices, concerns, and planned adaptations relating to these tools. Through this empirical study, our goal is to prompt dialogue between researchers and educators to inform new pedagogical strategies in response to the rapidly evolving landscape of AI code generation tools.},

abstract = {Deep learning training (DLT), e.g., large language model (LLM) training, has become one of the most important services in multitenant cloud computing. By deeply studying in-production DLT jobs, we observed that communication contention among different DLT jobs seriously influences the overall GPU computation utilization, resulting in the low efficiency of the training cluster. In this paper, we present Crux, a communication scheduler that aims to maximize GPU computation utilization by mitigating the communication contention among DLT jobs. Maximizing GPU computation utilization for DLT, nevertheless, is NP-Complete; thus, we formulate and prove a novel theorem to approach this goal by GPU intensity-aware communication scheduling. Then, we propose an approach that prioritizes the DLT flows with high GPU computation intensity, reducing potential communication contention. Our 96-GPU testbed experiments show that Crux improves 8.3% to 14.8% GPU computation utilization. The large-scale production trace-based simulation further shows that Crux increases GPU computation utilization by up to 23% compared with alternatives including Sincronia, TACCL, and CASSINI.},

The authors of this paper believe that this advance in technology is significant enough to prompt introspection in the data management community, similar to previous technological disruptions such as the advents of the world wide web, cloud computing, and statistical machine learning. We argue that the disruptive influence that LLMs will have on data management will come from two angles. (1) A number of hard database problems, namely, entity resolution, schema matching, data discovery, and query synthesis, hit a ceiling of automation because the system does not fully understand the semantics of the underlying data. Based on large training corpora of natural language, structured data, and code, LLMs have an unprecedented ability to ground database tuples, schemas, and queries in real-world concepts. We will provide examples of how LLMs may completely change our approaches to these problems. (2) LLMs blur the line between predictive models and information retrieval systems with their ability to answer questions. We will present examples showing how large databases and information retrieval systems have complementary functionality.},

abstract = {Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods detect anomalies without prior access to known normal or abnormal samples within target categories. Existing methods typically rely on pretrained multimodal models, computing similarities between manually crafted textual features representing ''normal'' or ''abnormal'' semantics and image patch features to detect anomalies. However, the generic descriptions of ''abnormal'' often fail to precisely match diverse types of anomalies across different object categories. Additionally, computing feature similarities for single patches struggles to pinpoint specific locations of anomalies with various sizes and scales. To address these issues, we propose a novel ZSAD method called FiLo, comprising two components: adaptively learned Fine-Grained Description (FG-Des) and position-enhanced High-Quality Localization (HQ-Loc). FG-Des introduces fine-grained anomaly descriptions for each category using Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs adaptively learned textual templates to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection. HQ-Loc, utilizing Grounding DINO for preliminary localization, position-enhanced text prompts, and Multi-scale Multi-shape Cross-modal Interaction (MMCI) module, facilitates more accurate localization of anomalies of different sizes and shapes. Experimental results on datasets like MVTec and VisA demonstrate that FiLo significantly improves the performance of ZSAD in both detection and localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an image-level AUC of 83.9% and a pixel-level AUC of 95.9% on the VisA dataset.

abstract = {The successful application cases of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning (ML) are driving traditional data centers to transform into intelligent computing data centers characterized by low latency, high bandwidth, high reliability, and zero packet loss. The demand for immense computing and ultra-low latency suggests that in-network computing (INC) may be a viable solution, such as In-network aggregation (INA). INA involves a hierarchical structure of switches and servers to form different Service Function Chains (SFCs) including switches, servers, physical links, and virtual links for accomplishing model training. However, the aggregation of heavy traffic in CTCs tends to a sudden and drastic increase in a specific node, greatly increasing the likelihood of node failure. To detect SFC failure in real time, we propose an in-network SFC failure detection approach based on INC. We introduce digital twins (DT) and propose a collaborative AI framework based on the data plane and control plane to avoid model overfitting. In addition, to reduce the computing consumption, we propose the concept of "multiple SFC chains multiple models" to customize each SFC failure detection model and validate the mechanism on a BMv2-based prototype, which implements a high-accuracy failure detection with minor performance degradation.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

abstract = {Model merging is a promising lightweight model empowerment technique that does not rely on expensive computing devices (e.g., GPUs) or require the collection of specific training data. Instead, it involves editing different upstream model parameters to absorb their downstream task capabilities. However, uncertified model merging can infringe upon the Intellectual Property (IP) rights of the original upstream models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the robustness of IP protection methods under model merging scenarios. Specifically, we investigate two state-of-the-art IP protection techniques: Quantization Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint, along with various advanced model merging technologies, such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. Experimental results indicate that current Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques cannot survive in the merged models, whereas model fingerprinting techniques can. Our research aims to highlight that model merging should be an indispensable consideration in the robustness assessment of model IP protection techniques, thereby promoting the healthy development of the open-source LLM community.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques, such as large language models and graph neural networks, have demonstrated impressive effectiveness across various web applications. Despite their success, the advancement of these methods is frequently hampered by different resource constraint challenges. Key challenges include the scarcity of labeled data (data-level constraints), the need for smaller model sizes that fit real-world computing environments (model-level constraints), and the integration of neural network design with system and hardware for energy efficiency (system-level constraints). Tackling these issues is essential for the effective and efficient deployment of models in various real-world web systems and applications, including social networks, search engines, recommender systems, question answering, and content analysis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and efficient learning techniques that can overcome these resource limitations. The proposed international workshop on ''Resource-Efficient Learning for the Web (RelWeb 2025)'' will provide a great venue for academic researchers and industrial practitioners to share challenges, solutions, and future opportunities for resource-efficient learning. Our workshop objectives are threefold: (1) to establish an engaging platform where experts and participants can share their latest research findings and innovative practices in resource-efficient learning; (2) to explore emerging technologies and trends that could shape the future of this field; and (3) to foster a collaborative environment that encourages partnerships and exchanges among participants. Together, we can advance resource-efficient learning and propel future research in this area.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown feasibility of an interactive pair-programming conversational agent, but implementing such an agent poses three challenges: a lack of benchmark datasets, absence of software engineering specific labels, and the need to understand developer conversations. To address these challenges, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study with 14 participants pair programming with a simulated agent and collected 4,443 developer-agent utterances. Based on this dataset, we created 26 software engineering labels using an open coding process to develop a hierarchical classification scheme. To understand labeled developer-agent conversations, we compared the accuracy of three state-of-the-art transformer-based language models, BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet, which performed interchangeably. In order to begin creating a developer-agent dataset, researchers and practitioners need to conduct resource intensive Wizard of Oz studies. Presently, there exists vast amounts of developer-developer conversations on video hosting websites. To investigate the feasibility of using developer-developer conversations, we labeled a publicly available developer-developer dataset (3,436 utterances) with our hierarchical classification scheme and found that a BERT model trained on developer-developer data performed ~10% worse than the BERT trained on developer-agent data, but when using transfer-learning, accuracy improved. Finally, our qualitative analysis revealed that developer-developer conversations are more implicit, neutral, and opinionated than developer-agent conversations. Our results have implications for software engineering researchers and practitioners developing conversational agents.},

abstract = {The data science ecosystem encompasses data fairness, statistical, ML and AI methods and tools, interpretable data analysis and results, and trustworthy decision-making. Rapid advancements in AI have revolutionized data utilization and enabled machines to learn from data more effectively. Statistics, as the science of learning from data while accounting for uncertainty, plays a pivotal role in addressing complex real-world problems and facilitating trustworthy decision-making. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges and opportunities involved in building an end-to-end scalable and interpretable data science ecosystem using the analysis of whole genome sequencing studies and biobanks that integrates statistics, ML/AI, and genomic and health science as an example. Biobanks collect whole genome data, electronic health records and epidemiological data. I will illustrate key points using the analysis of multi-ancestry whole genome sequencing studies and biobanks by discussing a few scalable and interpretable statistical and ML/AI methods, tools and data science resources.Specifically, first, data fairness and diversity is a critical pillar of a trustworthy data science ecosystem. About 85+% of genome wide association study samples in the last 15 years are European, resulting in disparity in genetic research. I will discuss the community effort on improving diversity in genetic studies in the last 10 years. I will present trans-ancestry polygenic risk scores (PRS) using millions of common genetic variants across the genome by leveraging large GWAS sample sizes of European and smaller sample sizes of under-represented populations for predicting disease risk using transfer learning and genetic association summary statistics. The performance of deep learning methods for PRS will also be discussed. Second, scalability in cloud platforms is critical for large scale affordable analysis for multi-ancestry biobanks and whole genome studies. I will discuss improving scalability in cloud-computing using interpretable sparsity via FastSparseGRM.To build an interpretable and powerful end-to-end ecosystem of rare variant analysis of large scale whole genome sequencing studies and biobanks, I will first introduce FAVOR, a multi-faceted variant functional annotation database and portal of all possible 9 billions of variants across the whole genome. I will discuss FAVOR-GPT, a LLM interface of the FAVOR functional annotation database to improve user experience for navigating FAVOR and performing variant functional annotation query and variant functional summary statistics calculations. I will also discuss FAVORannotator which can be used to functionally annotate any whole genome sequencing studies. I will also discuss STAAR and STAAR and STAARpipeline, the WGS rare variant analysis pipeline that boosts the power of WGS rare variant association analysis by dynamically incorporating multi-faceted variant functional annotations. Extension of incorporating single-cell data in WGS analysis will also be discussed. I will also discuss ensemble methods that improve the power of rare variant association tests.Cloud-deployment of these resources and tools in several ecosystems will be presented, such as RAP for the UK biobank, AnVIL for the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program and All of Us, and BioData Catalyst for the NHLBI Trans-omics Precision Medine Program (TOPMed). This talk aims to ignite proactive and thought-provoking discussions, foster collaboration, and cultivate open-minded approaches to advance scientific discovery.},

abstract = {Serverless computing, with its ease of management, auto-scaling, and cost-effectiveness, is widely adopted by deep learning (DL) applications. DL workloads, especially with large language models, require substantial GPU resources to ensure QoS. However, it is prone to produce GPU fragments (e.g., 15%-94%) in serverless DL systems due to the dynamicity of workloads and coarse-grained static GPU allocation mechanisms, gradually eroding the profits offered by serverless elasticity. Different from classical serverless systems that only scale horizontally, we present introspective elasticity (IE), a fine-grained and adaptive two-dimensional co-scaling mechanism to support GPU resourcing-on-demand for serverless DL tasks. Based on this insight, we build Dilu, a cross-layer and GPU-based serverless DL system with IE support. First, Dilu provides multi-factor profiling for DL tasks with efficient pruning search methods. Second, Dilu adheres to the resourcing-complementary principles in scheduling to improve GPU utilization with QoS guarantees. Third, Dilu adopts an adaptive 2D co-scaling method to enhance the elasticity of GPU provisioning in real time. Evaluations show that it can dynamically adjust the resourcing of various DL functions with low GPU fragmentation (10%-46% GPU defragmentation), high throughput (up to 1.8\texttimes{} inference and 1.1\texttimes{} training throughput increment) and QoS guarantees (11%-71% violation rate reduction), compared to the SOTA baselines.},

By integrating machine learning models with high-performance computing systems, our system facilitates continuous system health monitoring.

abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

abstract = {In recent years, as the field of new energy power has gradually become a research hotspot, there are more and more research results related to new energy power. This paper first proposes to Fine-tune the Chinese LLaMA large language model to realize the extraction of research questions and methods in new energy power results. The fine-tuning dataset is constructed by the combination of rule template and gpt-3.5 enhancement, which avoids the costly and time-consuming problem caused by manual construction. The fine-tuning method adopts LoRA high-efficiency fine-tuning to save computing resources; Then, F1 value is used as the evaluation index to compare the extraction effect of the model under different fine-tuning datasets. The results show that the model has a good extraction effect on the research questions and method terms when training the dataset constructed by the combination of rule template and gpt-3.5 enhancement. Finally, according to the extracted research question phrases, BTM(Biterm Topic Model) is used to study the distribution of topic words, and soft clustering of research question phrases is carried out according to the obtained topic words, so as to realize the correlation between the research results and professional terms, which provides the foundation for the future establishment of the knowledge graph and knowledge base of new energy power.CCS CONCEPTS • Theory of computation • Theory and algorithms for application domains • Unsupervised learning and clustering},

abstract = {Automated analysis of programming data using code representation methods offers valuable services for programmers, from code completion to clone detection to bug detection. Recent studies show the effectiveness of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), pre-trained Transformer-based models, and graph-based embeddings in programming code representation. However, pre-trained large language models lack interpretability, while other embedding-based approaches struggle with extracting important information from large ASTs. This study proposes a novel Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN) to address these gaps by integrating different components: an optimized sequential subtree extraction process using Genetic algorithm optimization, a two-way embedding approach, and an attention network. We investigate the effectiveness of SANN by applying it to two different tasks: program correctness prediction and algorithm detection on two educational datasets containing both small and large-scale code snippets written in Java and C, respectively. The experimental results show SANN's competitive performance against baseline models from the literature, including code2vec, ASTNN, TBCNN, CodeBERT, GPT-2, and MVG, regarding accurate predictive power. Finally, a case study is presented to show the interpretability of our model prediction and its application for an important human-centered computing application, student modeling. Our results indicate the effectiveness of the SANN model in capturing important syntactic and semantic information from students' code, allowing the construction of accurate student models, which serve as the foundation for generating adaptive instructional support such as individualized hints and feedback.},

abstract = {One of the primary areas of interest in High Performance Computing is the improvement of performance of parallel workloads. Nowadays, compilable source code-based optimization tasks that employ deep learning often exploit LLVM Intermediate Representations (IRs) for extracting features from source code. Most such works target specific tasks, or are designed with a pre-defined set of heuristics. So far, pre-trained models are rare in this domain, but the possibilities have been widely discussed. Especially approaches mimicking large-language models (LLMs) have been proposed. But these have prohibitively large training costs. In this paper, we propose MIREncoder, a Multi-modal IR-based Auto-Encoder that can be pre-trained to generate a learned embedding space to be used for downstream tasks by machine learning-based approaches. A multi-modal approach enables us to better extract features from compilable programs. It allows us to better model code syntax, semantics and structure. For code-based performance optimizations, these features are very important while making optimization decisions. A pre-trained model/embedding implicitly enables the usage of transfer learning, and helps move away from task-specific trained models. Additionally, a pre-trained model used for downstream performance optimization should itself have reduced overhead, and be easily usable. These considerations have led us to propose a modeling approach that i) understands code semantics and structure, ii) enables use of transfer learning, and iii) is small and simple enough to be easily re-purposed or reused even with low resource availability. Our evaluations will show that our proposed approach can outperform the state of the art while reducing overhead.},

abstract = {Objectives. Athletics and sports represent a focal part of adolescence for millions of youth around the world. However, opportunities to engage in computer science (CS) learning experiences are less prevalent, particularly among Hispanic and low-income communities. Recently, researchers have explored ways to bridge these, seemingly, disparate disciplines. Much of this prior research centers on the proliferation of sports technologies that support individualistic learning experiences. Additionally, many of these experiences are developed by researchers with limited design contributions from sports practitioners. To extend prior work, this project centers youth athletic identities and the associated cultural contexts of sports to explore ways that computing technologies can enhance and develop youth athletic identities and sports performance. Moreover, this work surfaces ways that athletics can be a generative and fulfilling space to learn about CS.Participants. In summer 2021, we collaborated with basketball coaches to design and implement a computing-enhanced learning experience with a basketball team of Hispanic participants in Puerto Rico. Eleven basketball athletes from a high school in southern Puerto Rico participated in the study. The participants have strong sports identities, as demonstrated by their lifelong engagement with team sports. Conversely, only one 1 of the 11 participants had experienced sports technologies, and none of them had previously participated in computing learning experiences.Study Method. In collaboration with local basketball coaches, we co-designed a learning experience that centers sports identities and practices and adds computing as a way to extend existing sports identities and local sports activities. We present and evaluate this learning experience using a design-based research approach. Participants’ feedback was collected in the form of surveys, designs, and journal entries, and additional data on their experiences were collected via videos and researchers’ field notes. Using a mixed-methods approach, we highlight existing participants’ identities and perceptions as well as their experiences with our design. We complement quantitative analysis of survey responses with case studies.Findings. We find that our design can provide shifts in youth student-athletes’ perceptions of computing. Additionally, hands-on experiences with computing tools enable participants to start practicing CS sensemaking via learning how different computing tools can support their sports performance individually and as a team. Furthermore, we find that the material, ideational, and relational resources made available through camp:bit supported each participant differently, while collectively providing a space for all of them to have meaningful and fulfilling experiences. Finally, we find that this design can foster and support sports team cohesion.Conclusions. We provide in-depth descriptions of our design, the youth’s engagement with it, and how these learning experiences can be further applied in sports spaces. These examples highlight a unique conception of practice-linked computational identities—where learners’ computational identities are grounded in a specific culturally relevant practice, enabling a more culturally sustaining computing learning experience. Finally, our analysis suggests five design principles for designing and conducting computing-supported learning experiences in sports environments. The principles are as follows: (1) Sports Experience: Authentically Support Existing Identities. (2) Team Dynamics: Team Athletes Are Part of a Whole. (3) Individual Pursuits: Supporting Individual Paths. (4) Direct Interactions: Conversations with Materials and Ideas. (5) Interdisciplinary Facilitation Team: Complementary Skills. These design principles can be used by researchers, practitioners, and local stakeholders to implement sport-centric CS learning experiences to extend and enhance the way student-athletes from marginalized communities practice sports, as well as to activate interest and engagement in CS.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in generative AI systems have raised concerns about academic integrity among educators. Beyond excelling at solving programming problems and text-based multiple-choice questions, recent research has also found that large multimodal models (LMMs) can solve Parsons problems based only on an image. However, such problems are still inherently text-based and rely on the capabilities of the models to convert the images of code blocks to their corresponding text. In this paper, we further investigate the capabilities of LMMs to solve graph and tree data structure problems based only on images. To achieve this, we computationally construct and evaluate a novel benchmark dataset comprising 9,072 samples of diverse graph and tree data structure tasks to assess the performance of the GPT-4o, GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision, and Claude 3 model families. GPT–4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash performed best on trees and graphs respectively. GPT-4o achieved 87.6% accuracy on tree samples, while Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieved 76.9% accuracy on graph samples. Our findings highlight the influence of structural and visual variations on model performance. This research not only introduces an LMM benchmark to facilitate replication and further exploration but also underscores the potential of LMMs in solving complex computing problems, with important implications for pedagogy and assessment practices.},

Generative AI is a field of artificial intelligence that can create new content and solve complex problems. RAG systems are a novel generative AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to generate rich and diverse responses. RAG systems can leverage enterprise data, which is often specific, structured, and dynamic, to provide customized solutions for various domains. However, enterprise data also poses challenges such as scalability, security, and data quality. This workshop convenes researchers and practitioners to explore RAG and other generative AI systems in real-world enterprise scenarios, fostering knowledge exchange, collaboration, and identification of future directions.

Research in this area, particularly on the educational implications, is nascent and has focused almost exclusively on introductory programming (or CS1) questions. Very recent work has shown that Codex performs considerably better on typical CS1 exam questions than most students. It is not clear, however, what Codex’s limits are with regard to more complex programming assignments and exams. In this paper, we present results detailing how Codex performs on more advanced CS2 (data structures and algorithms) exam questions taken from past exams. We compare these results to those of students who took the same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We consider the implications of such tools for the future of undergraduate computing education.},

abstract = {The Conversational Search (CS) paradigm allows for an intuitive interaction between the user and the system through natural language sentences and it is increasingly being adopted in various scenarios. However, its widespread experimentation has led to the birth of a multitude of conversational search systems with custom implementations and variants of information retrieval models. This exacerbates the reproducibility crisis already observed in several research areas, including Information Retrieval (IR). To address this issue, we propose DECAF: a modular and extensible conversational search framework designed for fast prototyping and development of conversational agents. Our framework integrates all the components that characterize a modern conversational search system and allows for the seamless integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs)-based techniques. Furthermore, thanks to its uniform interface, DECAF allows for experiments characterized by a high degree of reproducibility. DECAF contains several state-of-the-art components including query rewriting, search functions under BoW and dense paradigms, and re-ranking functions. Our framework is tested on two well-known conversational collections: TREC CAsT 2019 and TREC CAsT 2020 and the results can be used by future practitioners as baselines. Our contributions include the identification of a series of state-of-the-art components for the conversational search task and the definition of a modular framework for its implementation.},

abstract = {Security protocols, protocols to achieve consensus, those for maintaining memory consistency and coherence, distributed ledgers, multi-party computation, and many similar software systems are examples of distributed message-passing based computation. Ensuring correctness of such distributed systems is a challenging problem for many automatic verification approaches. The deductive verification approach for reasoning about such systems involves computing a program invariant, i.e., an expression evaluates to true for every reachable program state. Several approaches for synthesizing invariants are dynamic, i.e., runs of the program and ancillary information such as target safety properties are used to learn an invariant expression. However, most existing approaches invoke a model checker (or a theorem prover) within the synthesis loop, which makes these approaches depend on the scalability of the verification tools. In this paper, we propose a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis approach called RunVS which learns invariant expressions from program runs, but without information such as target safety properties, and without invoking a model checker/theorem prover for validation. The synthesis approach pairs a decision-tree (DT) based method with a data augmentation technique: DT-learning provides an expression that classifies observed states from augmented states that are speculated to be unreachable. Validation of the learned invariant is performed by sampling program runs and states; any run that invalidates the invariant results in counterexamples used to revises the invariant. As there is no formal proof that the learned artifact is a true invariant, we call such an expression a likely invariant. An important user input to synthesis is often the set of predicates that comprise the invariant expression; we use a novel integration with a large language model (LLM) and prompt it to provide likely predicates to be used. We show empirical results of our approach on several distributed protocols implemented in the Promela modeling language.},

As stated by UNESCO, cultural heritage provides societies with a wealth of resources inherited from the past, created in the present for the benefit of future generations. The massive digitization of historical analogue resources and production of born-digital documents provide us with large volumes of varied multimedia heritage data (images, maps, text, video, 3D objects, multi-sensor data, etc.), which represent a rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide variety of fields, from research in social sciences and computational humanities to land use and territorial policies, including urban modeling, digital simulation, archaeology, tourism, education, culture preservation, creative media and entertainment. In terms of research in computer science, artificial intelligence and digital humanities, they address challenging problems related to the diversity, specificity or volume of the media, the veracity of the data, and different user needs with respect to engaging with this rich material and the extraction of value out of the data. These challenges are reflected in the corresponding sub-fields of machine learning, signal processing, multi-modal techniques and human-machine interaction, with special focus on:Analysis of historical data,Content understanding and pattern recognition,Linking and recommendation of multi-modal digital heritage,Human-machine interaction for big data analysis and visualization,Generative modeling of cultural heritage.},

abstract = {In the realm of Software Engineering (SE), automation has become a tangible reality. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has suc-cessfully addressed challenges in project management, mod-eling, testing, and development. Among the latest innova-tions is ChatGPT, an ML-infused chatbot capable of gen-erating programming codes and software testing strategies. Although there is speculation that AI-based computation can boost productivity and even substitute software engineers in software development, empirical evidence supporting such claims is lacking. Moreover, questions remain about their po-tential to address overlooked evaluation metrics like energy efficiency, vulnerability, fairness (i.e., human bias), and safety. This paper probes into these issues with an empirical study, comparing ChatGPT with both novice and expert program-mers using LeetCode contest problems. The investigation focuses on performance and memory-efficiency, while also acknowledging the need for a broader assessment of non-functional requirements. The results suggest that ChatGPT is better than beginners at solving easy and medium prob-lems, but it is not yet proven to beat expert programmers. This paper posits that a comprehensive comparison of soft-ware engineers and AI-based solutions, considering various evaluation criteria, is pivotal in fostering human-machine collaboration, enhancing the reliability of AI-based meth-ods, and understanding task suitability for humans or AI. Furthermore, it facilitates the effective implementation of co-operative work structures and human-in-the-loop processes.},

abstract = {Dataflow graphs (DFGs) capture definitions (defs) and uses across program blocks, which is a fundamental program representation for program analysis, testing and maintenance. However, dynamically typed programming languages like Python present implicit dataflow issues that make it challenging to determine def-use flow information at compile time. Static analysis methods like Soot and WALA are inadequate for handling these issues, and manually enumerating comprehensive heuristic rules is impractical. Large pre-trained language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, as they have powerful language understanding and pattern matching abilities, allowing them to predict implicit dataflow by analyzing code context and relationships between variables, functions, and statements in code. We propose leveraging LLMs’ in-context learning ability to learn implicit rules and patterns from code representation and contextual information to solve implicit dataflow problems. To further enhance the accuracy of LLMs, we design a five-step chain of thought (CoT) and break it down into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chain, with each step corresponding to a separate AI unit to generate accurate DFGs for Python code. Our approach’s performance is thoroughly assessed, demonstrating the effectiveness of each AI unit in the AI Chain. Compared to static analysis, our method achieves 82% higher def coverage and 58% higher use coverage in DFG generation on implicit dataflow. We also prove the indispensability of each unit in the AI Chain. Overall, our approach offers a promising direction for building software engineering tools by utilizing foundation models, eliminating significant engineering and maintenance effort, but focusing on identifying problems for AI to solve.},

abstract = {In Infinite Story, students build a choose-your-own-adventure game that integrates generative AI to create a dynamic, interactive "infinite story" experience. The game is powered by nested dictionary (JSON) objects that store pre-existing scenes. Each scene is a nested dictionary, containing user choices, descriptions, and more. Students are challenged to navigate and manipulate these deeply nested data structures, which helps them appreciate the utility and complexity of dictionary objects. When a user ventures into an undefined scene, the program makes an API call to ChatGPT to generate the next scene, allowing the adventure to continue seamlessly. To the best of our knowledge it is one of the first assignments in intro CS that uses ChatGPT. What makes this assignment truly nifty is how it teaches students to leverage generative AI in a creative, meaningful way. By blending generative storytelling with technical skills, students get to see the power of AI in extending their projects beyond predefined boundaries, creating an open-ended, exciting experience. Many students expanded on this assignment for their final projects, creating sophisticated programs like AI-driven Chess and Go games. Using the techniques from this assignment, they leveraged the course's OpenAI integration to build functional AI agents that enhanced gameplay. These projects showcased the flexibility of the assignment, inspiring students to think critically about the creative and practical applications of AI in real-world contexts.},

abstract = {Memory management is fundamental to the performance of all applications. On modern server architectures, an application's memory allocator needs to balance memory utilization against the ability to use 2MB huge pages, which are crucial for achieving high performance. This paper shows that prior C++ memory allocators are fundamentally limited because optimizing this trade-off depends on the knowledge of object lifetimes, which is information allocators lack.We introduce a two-step approach to attain high memory utilization in huge pages. We first introduce a novel machine-learning approach that predicts the lifetime of freshly allocated objects using the stack trace at the time of allocation and treats stack traces as natural language. We then present a fundamentally new type of memory allocator that exploits (potentially incorrect) object lifetime predictions to achieve high memory utilization at full huge page usage. In contrast to prior memory allocators that organize their heap around size classes and free lists, our allocator organizes the heap based on predicted lifetime classes and adjusts to mispredictions on the fly. We demonstrate experimentally that this learned lifetime-aware memory allocator (LLAMA) reduces fragmentation with huge pages by up to 78%.Our approach gives rise to a new methodology for applying ML in computer systems. In addition, similar space-time bin packing problems abound in computer science and we discuss how this approach has applications beyond memory allocation to a wide range of problems.},

abstract = {Cloud systems have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their flexibility and scalability. Each time cloud computing applications and services hosted on the cloud are affected by a cloud outage, users can experience slow response times, connection issues or total service disruption, resulting in a significant negative business impact. Outages are usually comprised of several concurring events/source causes, and therefore understanding the context of outages is a very challenging yet crucial first step toward mitigating and resolving outages. In current practice, on-call engineers with in-depth domain knowledge, have to manually assess and summarize outages when they happen, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we first present a large-scale empirical study investigating the way on-call engineers currently deal with cloud outages at Microsoft, and then present and empirically validate a novel approach (dubbed Oasis) to help the engineers in this task. Oasis is able to automatically assess the impact scope of outages as well as to produce human-readable summarization. Specifically, Oasis first assesses the impact scope of an outage by aggregating relevant incidents via multiple techniques. Then, it generates a human-readable summary by leveraging fine-tuned large language models like GPT-3.x. The impact assessment component of Oasis was introduced in Microsoft over three years ago, and it is now widely adopted, while the outage summarization component has been recently introduced, and in this article we present the results of an empirical evaluation we carried out on 18 real-world cloud systems as well as a human-based evaluation with outage owners. The results obtained show that Oasis can effectively and efficiently summarize outages, and lead Microsoft to deploy its first prototype which is currently under experimental adoption by some of the incident teams.},

abstract = {Github Copilot, trained on billions of lines of public code, has recently become the buzzword in the computer science research and practice community. Although it is designed to help developers implement safe and effective code with powerful intelligence, practitioners and researchers raise concerns about its ethical and security problems, e.g., should the copyleft licensed code be freely leveraged or insecure code be considered for training in the first place? These problems pose a significant impact on Copilot and other similar products that aim to learn knowledge from large-scale open-source code through deep learning models, which are inevitably on the rise with the fast development of artificial intelligence. To mitigate such impacts, we argue that there is a need to invent effective mechanisms for protecting open-source code from being exploited by deep learning models. Here, we design and implement a prototype, CoProtector, which utilizes data poisoning techniques to arm source code repositories for defending against such exploits. Our large-scale experiments empirically show that CoProtector is effective in achieving its purpose, significantly reducing the performance of Copilot-like deep learning models while being able to stably reveal the secretly embedded watermark backdoors.},

abstract = {Software engineering research has always being concerned with the improvement of code completion approaches, which suggest the next tokens a developer will likely type while coding. The release of GitHub Copilot constitutes a big step forward, also because of its unprecedented ability to automatically generate even entire functions from their natural language description. While the usefulness of Copilot is evident, it is still unclear to what extent it is robust. Specifically, we do not know the extent to which semantic-preserving changes in the natural language description provided to the model have an effect on the generated code function. In this paper we present an empirical study in which we aim at understanding whether different but semantically equivalent natural language descriptions result in the same recommended function. A negative answer would pose questions on the robustness of deep learning (DL)-based code generators since it would imply that developers using different wordings to describe the same code would obtain different recommendations. We asked Copilot to automatically generate 892 Java methods starting from their original Javadoc description. Then, we generated different semantically equivalent descriptions for each method both manually and automatically, and we analyzed the extent to which predictions generated by Copilot changed. Our results show that modifying the description results in different code recommendations in ~46% of cases. Also, differences in the semantically equivalent descriptions might impact the correctness of the generated code (±28%).},

abstract = {Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is a promising execution environment for high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) applications as it offers developers a simple way to write and deploy programs. Nowadays, GPUs and other accelerators are indispensable for HPC and ML workloads. These accelerators are expensive to acquire and operate; consequently, multiplexing them can increase their financial profitability. However, we have observed that state-of-the-art FaaS frameworks usually treat accelerator as a single device to run single workload and have little support for multiplexing accelerators. In this work, we have presented techniques to multiplex GPUs with Parsl, a popular FaaS framework. We demonstrate why GPU multiplexing is beneficial for certain applications and how we have implemented GPU multiplexing in Parsl. With our enhancements, we show up to 60% lower task completion time and 250% improvement in the inference throughput of a large language model when multiplexing a GPU compared to running a single instance without multiplexing. We plan to extend the support for GPU multiplexing in FaaS platforms by tackling the challenges of changing compute resources in the partition and approximating how to right-size a GPU partition for a function.},

abstract = {High-quality data is essential for data science and machine learning applications, but unfortunately, real-world data often contains significant amounts of errors, such as typos, missing values, and data inconsistencies. Despite all the efforts in cleaning data using either logical or learning-based methods, in practice, data cleaning still requires high human cost, for either manually providing data repairing rules or preparing labeled datasets for training machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce GARF, a novel data cleaning system based on sequence generative adversarial networks (SeqGAN). One key information GARF tries to learn is data repair rules. To automatically extracts data repair rules from dirty data, GARF employs a SeqGAN to capture the dependency relationships, and converts the information learned by machine to interpretable data repair rules for humans. Additionally, considering that both generated rules and data may not be fully trusted, GARF provides a co-cleaning process to iteratively update inaccurate rules and repair dirty data until there is no tuple violating rules. We have implemented and deployed GARF as an open-sourced system, and demonstrated its usability on data cleaning in real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {Vulnerabilities in identity and access management (IAM) are one of the most common reasons for data breaches leading to adversarial impacts on security, privacy and compliance postures. Account breaches, incorrectly designed access control policies, weaknesses in authentication and credential management, vulnerable session management are some of the several security issues that lead to eventual compromise of the crown jewels leading to data breaches. The lifecycles of subjects and their identities, of objects and re- sources, and of the permissions and authorization policies are in- tertwined in a complex manner for each specific scenario. Often subjects, objects and permissions often are hard to be defined or isolated from each other, especially in the context of machine learn-ing. The evolution of these entities, and how their provenance is analyzed often is essential not only for forensic analysis of a breach but also should be a proactive ongoing process.  In order to manage the security issues and risks thereof, holistic end-to-end identity and access management in a secure and privacy- preserving manner is the need of yesterday, today and of the future. In the past couple of decades, we have encountered this problem time and again in various contexts in the settings of academic and industry research and in development/deployment of products, services and processes.  Three elements are the key ingredients in order to address this problem in a holistic manner: (1) graphs, (2) machine learning, and (3) decentralized computing (i.e., web3, blockchains). Further, with the advent of generative AI and large language models, the question arises about what problems they can help solve, or they can excerbate further, or what new challenges they can introduce. In this talk, I plan to delve into a discussion of the following: (a) the holistic and end-to-end nature of IAM, (b) the interplay between these three elements - graphs, machine learning, Web3 as well as generative AI, and how they can help, and (c) the research challenges that need to be addressed in order to reduce the security, privacy and compliance risks in identity and access management.},

abstract = {Computer intelligent recognition technology refers to the use of computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and other technologies to enable computers to recognize, analyze, understand and answer human language and behavior. The common applications of computer intelligent recognition technology include image recognition, NLP, face recognition, target tracking, and other fields. NLP is a field of computer science, which involves the interaction between computers and natural languages. NLP technology can be used to process, analyze and generate natural language data, such as text, voice and image. Common NLP technology applications include language translation, emotion analysis, text classification, speech recognition and question answering system. Language model is a machine learning model, which uses a large number of text data for training to learn language patterns and relationships in text data. Although the language model has made great progress in the past few years, it still faces some challenges, including: poor semantic understanding, confusion in multilingual processing, slow language processing and other shortcomings. Therefore, in order to optimize these shortcomings, this article would study the pre-training language model based on NLP technology, which aimed at using NLP technology to optimize and improve the performance of the language model, thus optimizing the computer intelligent recognition technology. The model had a higher language understanding ability and more accurate prediction ability. In addition, the model could learn language rules and structures by using a large number of corpus, so as to better understand natural language. Through experiments, it could be known that the data size and total computing time of the traditional Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) language model were 10 GB and 97 hours respectively. The data size and total computing time of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) were 12 GB and 86 hours respectively. The data size and total computing time of the pre-training language model based on NLP were 18 GB and 71 hours respectively. Obviously, the pre-training language model based on NLP had a larger data size and shorter computing time. The experimental results showed that the NLP technology could better optimize the language model and effectively improve its various capabilities. This article opened up a new development direction for computer intelligent recognition technology and provided excellent technical support for the development of language models.},

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

abstract = {Large language models have become an important research direction in the field of deep learning, and have received extensive attention from academia and industry. These models excel in natural language processing tasks, significantly improving the performance of downstream tasks. However, due to the large scale of the model, high-performance computing resources are required for deployment, and the latency problem in the inference process also limits its practical use in some industrial applications. Therefore, how to optimize these models to improve their practical application effect is still an urgent problem to be solved. In this work, by optimising the model architecture, introducing sparsity techniques, using quantisation methods and adopting distributed training strategies, we have achieved a substantial reduction in the computational overhead and memory requirements of large-scale language models, while simultaneously improving the inference speed and training efficiency. Firstly, the model architecture was optimised in order to reduce redundant calculations and enhance the parameter efficiency of the model, particularly in the design of the self-attention mechanism and the feedforward network layer. Secondly, the incorporation of sparsity technology has the potential to reduce the number of parameters and the amount of computation without a significant impact on the model's performance. This is achieved through the utilisation of sparse matrix multiplication and pruning techniques, which serve to minimise unnecessary computation. Furthermore, the quantization method markedly diminishes the memory footprint and bandwidth requirements by transforming the model weights and activation functions from high-precision floating-point numbers to low-precision representations, thereby enhancing the computational efficiency of the model. In the training process, a distributed training strategy was employed, utilising a combination of data parallelism and model parallelism to optimise the use of computing resources across multiple machines, thereby significantly reducing the training time. The results of the experimental analysis demonstrate that these methods can markedly enhance the speed of both inference and training, while concurrently reducing the consumption of resources, whilst maintaining the performance of the model.},

abstract = {Recent language models have demonstrated proficiency in summarizing source code. However, as in many other domains of machine learning, language models of code lack sufficient explainability --- informally, we lack a formulaic or intuitive understanding of what and how models learn from code. Explainability of language models can be partially provided if, as the models learn to produce higher-quality code summaries, they also align in deeming the same code parts important as those identified by human programmers. In this paper, we report negative results from our investigation of explainability of language models in code summarization through the lens of human comprehension. We measure human focus on code using eye-tracking metrics such as fixation counts and duration in code summarization tasks. To approximate language model focus, we employ a state-of-the-art model-agnostic, black-box, perturbation-based approach, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to identify which code tokens influence that generation of summaries. Using these settings, we find no statistically significant relationship between language models' focus and human programmers' attention. Furthermore, alignment between model and human foci in this setting does not seem to dictate the quality of the LLM-generated summaries. Our study highlights an inability to align human focus with SHAP-based model focus measures. This result calls for future investigation of multiple open questions for explainable language models for code summarization and software engineering tasks in general, including the training mechanisms of language models for code, whether there is an alignment between human and model attention on code, whether human attention can improve the development of language models, and what other model focus measures are appropriate for improving explainability.},

abstract = {External help resources are frequently used by novice programmers solving classwork in undergraduate computing courses. Traditionally, these tools consisted of web resources such as tutorial websites and Q&amp;A forums. With the rise of Generative AI (GenAI), there has been increasing concern and research about how external resources should be used in the classroom. However, little work has directly contrasted student beliefs and perceptions of web resources with GenAI, has grounded these beliefs in prior psychological theory, and has investigated how demographic factors and student backgrounds influence these beliefs and intentions. We administered a vignette-style survey across two courses required for a CS major at an R1 University, a freshman (n = 152) and senior capstone course (n = 44). Students responded to likert questions aiming to measure behavioral factors related to these tools, such as intention to use, perceived attitudes, peer perceptions, and their own perceived tool competency. We primarily investigate the results of an introductory course, finding that novices have a wide range of opinions on both resources, but overall find them slightly useful and have a tendency to prefer web-search. We compare this with seniors, who have more positive perceptions of these tools, and discuss possible reasons and implications for this difference. We constructed two path models to investigate which factors strongly influence novices’ intention to use resources and find the primary factor to be their general attitudes in how these tools will result in a positive or negative outcome (e.g. perceived benefits, justifiability). We also measure the effects of student background on intention to use these resources. Finally, we discuss implications and suggestions on how instructors can use this information to approach, address, and influence resource usage in their classrooms.},

abstract = {Pre-trained Generative Language models (e.g., PLBART, CodeT5, SPT-Code) for source code yielded strong results on several tasks in the past few years, including code generation and translation. These models have adopted varying pre-training objectives to learn statistics of code construction from very large-scale corpora in a self-supervised fashion; the success of pre-trained models largely hinges on these pre-training objectives. This paper proposes a new pre-training objective, “Naturalizing” of source code, exploiting code’s bimodal, dual-channel (formal &amp; natural channels) nature. Unlike natural language, code’s bimodal, dual-channel nature allows us to generate semantically equivalent code at scale. We introduce six classes of semantic preserving transformations to introduce unnatural forms of code, and then force our model to produce more natural original programs written by developers. Learning to generate equivalent, but more natural code, at scale, over large corpora of open-source code, without explicit manual supervision, helps the model learn to both ingest &amp; generate code. We fine-tune our model in three generative Software Engineering tasks: code generation, code translation, and code refinement with limited human-curated labeled data and achieve state-of-the-art performance rivaling CodeT5. We show that our pre-trained model is especially competitive at zero-shot and few-shot learning, and better at learning code properties (e.g., syntax, data flow)},

abstract = {Investigation of students’ perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking. In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly. We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall ‘23, winter ‘23, and spring ‘24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time. We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has become a key component of modern software. In the “big model” era, the rich features of DL-based software (i.e., DL software) substantially rely on powerful DL models, e.g., BERT, GPT-3, and the recently emerging GPT-4, which are trained on the powerful cloud with large datasets. Hence, training effective DL models has become a vital stage in the whole software lifecycle. When training deep learning models, especially those big models, developers need to parallelize and distribute the computation and memory resources amongst multiple devices (e.g., a cluster of GPUs) in the training process, which is known as distributed deep learning training, or distributed training for short. However, the unique challenges that developers encounter in distributed training process have not been studied in the software engineering community. Given the increasingly heavy dependence of current DL-based software on distributed training, this paper aims to fill in the knowledge gap and presents the first comprehensive study on developers’ issues in distributed training. To this end, we focus on popular DL frameworks that support distributed training (including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Horovod) and analyze 1,131 real-world developers’ issues about using these frameworks reported on Stack Overflow and GitHub. We construct a fine-grained taxonomy consisting of 30 categories regarding the fault symptoms and summarize common fix patterns for different symptoms. We find that: (1) many distributed-specific faults and non-distributed-specific faults inherently share the same fault symptoms, making it challenging to debug; (2) most of the fault symptoms have frequent fix patterns; (3) about half of the faults are related to system-level configurations. Based on the results, we suggest actionable implications on research avenues that can potentially facilitate the distributed training to develop DL-based software, such as focusing on the frequent and common fix patterns when designing testing or debugging tools, developing efficient testing and debugging techniques for communication configuration along with the synthesis of network configuration analysis, designing new multi-device checkpoint-and-replay techniques to help reproduction, and designing serverless APIs for cloud platforms.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

In recent years, generative AI, enhanced by GPT technology, has been widely adopted in the IT industry as well as computing education. However, little work has been done to investigate the applicability of GPT to teaching assembly language. In this paper, we fill in the gap by providing an empirical study of GPT's ability to interpret assembly instructions. In particular, we manually evaluated GPT-4's per-instruction explanations of code segments for four different computer architectures, namely x86, x86-64, ARM, and AArch64. Our study shows that, while inconsistencies and rare errors do exist, GPT's interpretations are highly accurate in general, demonstrating a great potential for such tools to be applied in pedagogical practices for tutoring assembly language.},

abstract = {Context: Modern chatbots, built upon advanced language models, have achieved remarkable proficiency in answering questions across diverse fields. Problem: Understanding the capabilities and limitations of these chatbots is a significant challenge, particularly as they are integrated into different information systems, including those in education. Solution: In this study, we conducted a quantitative assessment of the ability of two prominent chatbots, ChatGPT and Bard, to solve POSCOMP questions. IS Theory: The IS theory used in this work is Information processing theory. Method: We used a total of 271 questions from the last five POSCOMP exams that did not rely on graphic content as our materials. We presented these questions to the two chatbots in two formats: directly as they appeared in the exam and with additional context. In the latter case, the chatbots were informed that they were answering a multiple-choice question from a computing exam. Summary of Results: On average, chatbots outperformed human exam-takers by more than 20%. Interestingly, both chatbots performed better, in average, without additional context added to the prompt. They exhibited similar performance levels, with a slight advantage observed for ChatGPT. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The primary contribution to the field involves the exploration of the capabilities and limitations of chatbots in addressing computing-related questions. This information is valuable for individuals developing Information Systems with the assistance of such chatbots or those relying on technologies built upon these capabilities.},

abstract = {Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) has become pervasive in all aspects of computing, so it is essential that students include parallelism and distribution in the computational thinking that they apply to problem solving, from the beginning of their computing education. With all computing devices that students use having multiple cores as well as a GPU in many cases, many students' favorite applications use multiple cores and/or distributed processors. However, we are still teaching them to solve problems using only sequential thinking. Why?This hands-on tutorial will demonstrate how easy it is to open students' eyes to exploiting concurrency in problem solving. You will participate in plugged and unplugged activities that will help students to recognize examples of PDC concepts and concurrency in the world around them. We introduce plugged and unplugged curriculum modules that have been successfully integrated in existing computing classes at multiple institutions. We will also discuss recent efforts at integrating AI methods, including LLMs, into introductory classes.A laptop capable of running a C/C++ compiler, a Java virtual environment, and a Python interpreter is needed to fully participate in activities. However, attendees may learn the core concepts without a laptop. The activities and curriculum modules have been used successfully to teach PDC concepts in early computing courses and will be available after the workshop. Participants will receive a stipend of 400 to defray their cost of registration and one-night hotel stay. The CDER center will also have a booth in the exhibition hall for additional support.},

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been driven by an exponential growth in digitised data. Natural language processing, in particular, has been transformed by machine learning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 which generates human-like text so realistic that its developers have warned of the dangers of its misuse. In recent months OpenAI released Codex, a new deep learning model trained on Python code from more than 50 million GitHub repositories. Provided with a natural language description of a programming problem as input, Codex generates solution code as output. It can also explain (in English) input code, translate code between programming languages, and more. In this work, we explore how Codex performs on typical introductory programming problems. We report its performance on real questions taken from introductory programming exams and compare it to results from students who took these same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We then explore how Codex handles subtle variations in problem wording using several published variants of the well-known “Rainfall Problem” along with one unpublished variant we have used in our teaching. We find the model passes many test cases for all variants. We also explore how much variation there is in the Codex generated solutions, observing that an identical input prompt frequently leads to very different solutions in terms of algorithmic approach and code length. Finally, we discuss the implications that such technology will have for computing education as it continues to evolve, including both challenges and opportunities.},

Even though there are many phishing detection methods in literature, most of them neglect the imbalanced nature of phishing email datasets. In this paper, we examine the imbalanced property by varying legitimate to phishing class ratios. We generate new synthetic instances using a generative adversarial network model for long sentences (LeakGAN) to balance out the training process and ameliorate its impact on classification. These synthetic instances are labeled by positive-unlabeled learning and added to the initial imbalanced training set. The resulting dataset is given to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for sequence classification. We compare several state-of-the-art methods from the literature against our approach, which achieves a high performance throughout all the imbalanced ratios reaching an F1-score of 99.6% for the most extreme imbalanced ratio and an F1-score of 99.8% for balanced cases.},

abstract = {Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly being used in higher education computing classrooms across the United States. While scholars have looked at overall institutional guidance for the use of GenAI and reports have documented the response from schools in the form of broad guidance to instructors, we do not know what policies and practices instructors are actually adopting and how they are being communicated to students through course syllabi. To study instructors' policy guidance, we collected 98 computing course syllabi from 54 R1 institutions in the U.S. and studied the GenAI policies they adopted and the surrounding discourse. Our analysis shows that 1) most instructions related to GenAI use were as part of the academic integrity policy for the course and 2) most syllabi prohibited or restricted GenAI use, often warning students about the broader implications of using GenAI, e.g. lack of veracity, privacy risks, and hindering learning. Beyond this, there was wide variation in how instructors approached GenAI including a focus on how to cite GenAI use, conceptualizing GenAI as an assistant, often in an anthropomorphic manner, and mentioning specific GenAI tools for use. We discuss the implications of our findings and conclude with current best practices for instructors.},

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical aspect of learning and problem-solving for computing students. Recent research has shown that many students are aware of generative AI (GenAI) tools; however, there are gaps in the extent and effectiveness of how students use them. With over two years of widespread GenAI usage, it is crucial to understand whether students' help-seeking behaviors with these tools have evolved and how. This paper presents findings from a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted among computing students across North American universities ( n=95 ). Our results indicate shifts in GenAI usage patterns. In 2023, 34.1% of students ( n=47 ) reported never using ChatGPT for help, ranking it fourth after online searches, peer support, and class forums. By 2024, this figure dropped sharply to 6.3% ( n=48 ), with ChatGPT nearly matching online search as the most commonly used help resource. Despite this growing prevalence, there has been a decline in students' hourly and daily usage of GenAI tools, which may be attributed to a common tendency to underestimate usage frequency. These findings offer new insights into the evolving role of GenAI in computing education, highlighting its increasing acceptance and solidifying its position as a key help resource.},

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical way that students learn new concepts, acquire new skills, and get unstuck when problem-solving in their computing courses. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers students a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it is unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources along dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing students now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected survey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our results suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have not yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources that students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors. Finally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with generative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate benefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We discuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing classrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented development of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the teaching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning for the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and informal contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rapid advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges for the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show potential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences and outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empirical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topics (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that examine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instructional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventions at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on student learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome studies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholders' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interactions with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using generative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at scale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support learning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, tangible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of existing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Research that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from underrepresented groups.},

With students arriving at university already experienced with using ChatGPT for work across the academic spectrum, educators were under pressure to somehow address the presence of this new resource in their classroom. This article describes both the “climate of fear” surrounding ChatGPT’s impacts on education and an attempt by the authors to induct ChatGPT as a colleague instead of an adversary. While creating a video series where we used ChatGPT to generate practice exercises for CS1 and CS2, we found it to be patient, charismatic and friendly, but also sometimes obstinate, misinformed, stubborn and confused; in other words, it was surprisingly human.},

abstract = {The excitement around ChatGPT 3.5 underscores its potential to transform various fields in education, including STEM. However, we must approach these claims cautiously. While AI can enhance STEM education, there are ethical concerns and potential inaccuracies linked to unsupervised automated responses. To comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT's influence on STEM, we conducted a controlled experiment that involved answering a question set in mathematics and CS in a time-limited session. To avoid bias, we recruited four groups of math and CS students with similar abilities -each group comprised five students. Two groups utilized ChatGPT, while the other two did not. Students who used ChatGPT were tasked with explaining how and where they employed the tool. Conversely, students who did not use ChatGPT were asked to showcase their problem-solving process. We analyzed the responses from these four groups, alongside the analysis of ChatGPT conversations for those who employed ChatGPT. Performance, confidence level, and completion time of each participant were recorded. Experts in mathematics and CS were then consulted to review participant responses. These experts were subsequently interviewed to gain deeper insights and draw conclusive findings. Our findings show that students who didn't use ChatGPT in Mathematics scored better than those who did, Specifically, ChatGPT provided the correct working process but yielded a wrong final answer due to arithmetic mistakes. Similarly, in programming, ChatGPT led to less elegant code. Our findings provide valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of AI integration in these fields, helping educators and students to adapt to AI advancements.},

abstract = {Automated assistance for detecting cheating on programs has long been investigated by CS educators, especially with the rise of "homework help" websites over the past decade, and recently with AI tools like ChatGPT. The main detection approach has long been flagging similar submission pairs. Modern cheating, like hiring contractors or using ChatGPT, may not yield such similarity. And, cases based on similarity alone may be weak. Thus, over the past several years, building on logs from an online program auto-grader (zyBooks), we developed additional "cheating concern metrics": points rate, style anomalies, style inconsistencies, IP address anomalies, code replacements, and initial copying. Most are defined not only for one programming assignment but also across a set of assignments. The metrics can help catch more kinds of cheating, provide more compelling evidence of cheating, reduce false cheating accusations based on similarity alone, and help instructors focus their limited cheat-detection time on the most egregious cases. We describe the techniques, and our experiences (via our own Python scripts and a commercial tool) for several terms, showing benefits of having more metrics than just similarity. Of 30 cheating cases over 3 terms and 300 students, most were based on metrics beyond similarity, all students admitted, none later contested, and time per student was only 1-2 hours (far less than previously). Our goal is to prevent cheating in the first place, by reducing opportunity via strong detection tools, as part of a multi-faceted approach to having students truly learn and stay out of trouble.},

abstract = {Over the past year (2022–2023), recently-released AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have gained significant attention from computing educators. Both researchers and practitioners have discovered that these tools can generate correct solutions to a variety of introductory programming assignments and accurately explain the contents of code. Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs. Our study findings capture a rare snapshot in time in early 2023 as computing instructors are just starting to form opinions about this fast-growing phenomenon but have not yet converged to any consensus about best practices. Using these findings as inspiration, we synthesized a diverse set of open research questions regarding how to develop, deploy, and evaluate AI coding tools for computing education.},

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving Generative AI (GenAI) landscape, source code and natural language are being mixed and used in new ways. This presents opportunities for rethinking teaching practice in Introductory Programming (CS1) courses that includes, but goes beyond, assessment. In this paper we examine the reasons why and how instructors who are early adopters of GenAI are using it in their teaching, and why others are not. We also explore the changes and adaptations that are currently being made to practice. This is achieved by synthesizing insights from several recent studies that have collected primary data from introductory programming instructors who are teaching with, considering teaching with, or actively not teaching with GenAI.Due to the fast pace of GenAI development and adoption, the fixed-pace and cyclical nature of education, and the relatively slow pace of research (including ethical approvals) and publication cycles, research with primary data from instructors is only being published relatively recently. In computing education, there is not yet enough published research with primary data from CS1 instructors to warrant a systematic literature review, although in the next year this will likely be possible. Based on an analysis of the nascent research that has been published, we propose emerging and flexible guidelines on how CS1 instructors could adapt their practice based on what others have done so far. These guidelines highlight important factors to consider when integrating GenAI in CS1 courses, which for many is only beginning.},

These new tools offer students personalized help or attempt to teach prompting skills without undercutting code comprehension.

The talk will present an overview of significant AI policy developments, including the European Union's AI Act, the over 120 AI-related bills currently pending in the United States Congress, and the United Arab Emirates' launch of a state-of-the-art open-source AI model. These examples will be contextualized within the history of how the current active regulatory stance diverges from prior approaches to technologies like the internet and social media, and consider the potential implications of this shift.  Equally important to understanding how AI policy is evolving is understanding why. Many legislative efforts are driven by concerns about AI's potential to exacerbate societal harms, such as election misinformation, cybersecurity threats, nonconsensual sexual imagery, weapons development, data privacy violations, intellectual property appropriation, labor market disruptions, and algorithmic biases. Coupled with these concerns is a widespread skepticism toward the tech industry's capacity for responsible self-governance. This context underscores the need for computing educators to engage students on issues of policy, ethics, and justice throughout the curriculum, to cultivate future professionals who can earn public trust and who appreciate the role of governments in establishing balance between innovation and safety guardrails.  Finally, the talk will offer reflections on the experience of serving as a technical adviser to policymakers, and advocate for computing educators to consider public service engagement on AI policy as a compelling career trajectory for themselves and their students.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly impacting how we live, and the increased capabilities of generative AI applications have positioned AI firmly in the public domain. There is a growing interest in what AI might look like as a subject within the K-12 curriculum, whilst research on teachers’ readiness for teaching AI is as yet limited. This paper describes a qualitative study investigating teachers’ readiness to teach AI in secondary education. The interview study involved eight computing teachers with varying teaching experiences. We used reflexive thematic analysis for themes development. Findings suggest several indicators of teachers’ readiness, including attitudes, prior AI experience, professional development, and access to quality resources. This paper contributes to ongoing debates about how to best support teachers to be ready to teach AI effectively at the school level.},

abstract = {Introductory programming courses often emphasize mastering syntax and basic constructs before progressing to more complex and interesting programs. This bottom-up approach can be frustrating for novices, shifting the focus away from problem solving and potentially making computing less appealing to a broad range of students. The rise of generative AI for code production could partially address these issues by fostering new skills via interaction with AI models, including constructing high-level prompts and evaluating code that is automatically generated. In this experience report, we explore the inclusion of two prompt-focused activities in an introductory course, implemented across four labs in a six-week module. The first requires students to solve computational problems by writing natural language prompts, emphasizing problem-solving over syntax. The second involves students crafting prompts to generate code equivalent to provided fragments, to foster an understanding of the relationship between prompts and code. Most of the students in the course had reported finding programming difficult to learn, often citing frustrations with syntax and debugging. We found that self-reported difficulty with learning programming had a strong inverse relationship with performance on traditional programming assessments such as tests and projects, as expected. However, performance on the natural language tasks was less strongly related to self-reported difficulty, suggesting they may target different skills. Learning how to communicate with AI coding models is becoming an important skill, and natural language prompting tasks may appeal to a broad range of students.},

abstract = {Background: Quantum computing is a rapidly growing new programming paradigm that brings significant changes to the design and implementation of algorithms. Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers. Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers’ understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms. Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds. Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.},

abstract = {Generative AI is a recent breakthrough in AI. While it has become a hot topic in computing education research (CER), much of the recent research has focused on e.g. issues of plagiarism or academic integrity. One problem spot with Generative AI is its susceptibility to various kinds of algorithmic bias. In this study, we collected data from an introductory computing course, where students experimented with text-to-image generative models and reflected on their generated image sets, in terms of biases, related harms, and possible fixes. Data were collected in Fall 2023 (pilot data in Fall 2022). Data included reports from 163 students. The results show (1) a variety of bias types observed by students related to gender, ethnicity, age, as well as a variety of bias types not observed by students, (2) two major types of attributions for the source of bias: bias caused by biases in the society and bias caused by data or algorithms, and (3) a number of potential harms associated with the biases, as well as attributions of those harms in specific contexts and use cases.},

abstract = {Non-native English speakers (NNES) face multiple barriers to learning programming. These barriers can be obvious, such as the fact that programming language syntax and instruction are often in English, or more subtle, such as being afraid to ask for help in a classroom full of native English speakers. However, these barriers are frustrating because many NNES students know more about programming than they can articulate in English. Advances in generative AI (GenAI) have the potential to break down these barriers because state of the art models can support interactions in multiple languages. Moreover, recent work has shown that GenAI can be highly accurate at code generation and explanation. In this paper, we provide the first exploration of NNES students prompting in their native languages (Arabic, Chinese, and Portuguese) to generate code to solve programming problems. Our results show that students are able to successfully use their native language to solve programming problems, but not without some difficulty specifying programming terminology and concepts. We discuss the challenges they faced, the implications for practice in the short term, and how this might transform computing education globally in the long term.},

abstract = {Problem decomposition is an important skill in programming, allowing learners to break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals. However, translating these subgoals into executable code poses a significant challenge for novice programmers. In this study conducted in an introductory programming course, learners received instruction in stepwise refinement and integration of AI-generated code within their assignments. Throughout the course, learners were permitted to rely on AI code generators, following opportunities to receive feedback on their ability to read and write code without AI assistance.  Our findings show that learners frequently relied on AI-generated code when working on assignments outside the classroom, but that the frequency of reliance varied from one assignment to another. The reliance on AI-generated code was not correlated with the learners' year in their degree, nor whether they were enrolled in a CS degree or not. Instead, it was associated with their prior knowledge, as learners who were less proficient in reading and writing code were more likely to seek AI assistance.  AI tools were primarily used to translate subgoals into code, fix errors, and explain algorithmic concepts. Few learners encountered difficulties in understanding or integrating AI generated code into their solutions. Overall, learner performance in meeting assignment requirements was relatively high, regardless of their prior knowledge or reliance on AI code generators. We conclude that leveraging the capabilities of generative AI can effectively bridge the gap between problem-solving and implementation, enabling learners to engage in skills that might otherwise be beyond their reach.},

In addition, CS1 is a notoriously fickle and often changing course, and many might find it beneficial to know what other instructors are doing across the globe; perhaps more so as we continue to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on computing education and as the effects of Generative AI take hold. Expanding upon several surveys conducted in Australasia, the UK, and Ireland, this survey facilitates a direct comparison of global trends in CS1. The survey goes beyond environmental factors such as languages used, and examines why CS1 instructors teach what they do, in the ways they do. In total the survey spans 84 institutions and 91 courses in which a total of over 40,000 students are enrolled.},

abstract = {As data corpus-driven tools and technologies increasingly push users to passively search for an answer, rather than search to understand, we believe that technical and computing disciplinary writing courses have a duty to teach the process of responsible data storytelling. While students can grasp that generative AI makes mistakes, hallucinates, and perpetuates bias, they can need help understanding the antecedent causes of those difficulties. All algorithmically driven decision-making or recommending software have in common a large data set that has been labeled, either by users or by the system itself. The origins of that data and the reasonable applications/deductions and conclusions possible for any given dataset have everything to do with why some tools help and some tools perpetuate harms. By starting at the very beginning and asking students to make sense of data, students can more easily see how purpose and audience impact analysis of any given collection of data. Once those opportunities for rhetorical choice making are known, students become ready to understand the connection between data and complex A.I. systems and some of the ways that bias and other kinds of harm can result if designers are not careful. Combining instruction in a technical coding environment with basic data literacy lessons such as ‘the seven data stories,’ [14] we developed and delivered a three-week writing unit designed around responsible data exploration and storytelling. In this experience report, we provide the assignment we used, and the scaffolded activities we employed to bring students through the process, remarking on what worked well and what we want to improve. We provide attendees with a link to an R-based notebook with a walk-through lesson on data exploration commands, and the rubric used to assess students’ texts, notebooks with code and commentary and results, all existing in a referential context. We provide the survey results of students’ perception of learning from this activity. Early findings demonstrate that students internalized lessons about the non-objective nature of data analysis and of specific responsible data storytelling practices required by anyone seeking to ethically represent answers within and limitations of any dataset.},

abstract = {The rise of microarchitectural attacks has necessitated robust detection and mitigation strategies to secure computing systems. Traditional tools, such as static and dynamic code analyzers and attack detectors, often fall short due to their reliance on predefined patterns and heuristics that lack the flexibility to adapt to new or evolving attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a microarchitecture security assistant, built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5, which we refer to as μLAM. This assistant surpasses conventional tools by not only identifying vulnerable code segments but also providing context-aware mitigations, tailored to specific system specifications and existing security measures. Additionally, μLAM leverages real-time data from dynamic Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) and system specifications to detect ongoing attacks, offering a level of adaptability and responsiveness that static and dynamic analyzers cannot match.For fine-tuning μLAM, we utilize a comprehensive dataset that includes system configurations, mitigations already in place for different generations of systems, dynamic HPC values, and both vulnerable and non-vulnerable source codes. This rich dataset enables μLAM to harness its advanced LLM natural language processing capabilities to understand and interpret complex code patterns and system behaviors, learning continuously from new data to improve its predictive accuracy and respond effectively in real time to both known and novel threats, making it an indispensable tool against microarchitectural threats. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of μLAM by fine-tuning and testing it on code utilizing well-known cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL, Libgcrypt, and NaCl, thereby illustrating its effectiveness in securing critical and complex software environments.},

This study takes on a restorying approach at the elementary level, where 9 fourth-grade students engaged in focus group discussions over three days to generate prompts for a generative AI art. Through the lens of restorying, the prompts had students conceptualize a future with a focus on their Mexican-American heritage, local community, and technology. The study revealed that students associated their heritage with symbolic representations such as food and music, and characterized the community as a commercialized space while also emphasizing locations conducive to family-oriented activities. As a result, technology in community spaces was associated with consumerism. However, when envisioning a futuristic, transformed community, they made deeper connections between the role of technology in the community, making intricate connections between community improvements and technology-based solutions. This underscores the need for computing education to dedicate time for young learners to reflect on the role technology has on their current culture and community to make deeper connections.},

Our research focuses on three areas: curriculum, teacher-professional learning and policy. The denouement of this aims to identify trends and shortfalls for AI in and for K-12 informatics education. We will systematically review the current literature to identify themes and emerging trends in AI education at K-12. This will be done under two facets, curricula and teacher-professional learning. In addition, we will conduct interviews and surveys with educators and AI experts. Next, we will examine the current policy (such as the European AI Act, and European Commission guidelines on the use of AI and data in education and training as well as international counterparts). Policies are often developed by both educators and experts in the domain, thus providing a source of topics or areas that may be added to our findings. Finally, by synthesising insights from educators, AI experts, and policymakers, as well as the literature and policy, our working group seeks to highlight possible future trends and shortfalls.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have led to the emergence of generative AI models that exhibit extraordinary performance at producing human-like outputs. Using only simple input prompts, it is possible to generate novel text, images, video, music, and source code, as well as tackle tasks such as answering questions and translating and summarising text.However, the potential for these models to impact computing education practice is only just beginning to be explored. For example, novices learning to code can now use free tools that automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments; yet these tools were not designed with novices in mind and little to nothing is known about how they will impact learning. Furthermore, much attention has focused on the immediate challenges these models present, such as academic integrity concerns. It seems that even in the AI-era a pending apocalypse sells better than a promising renaissance.Generative AI will likely play an increasing role in people's lives in the reasonably foreseeable future. Model performance seems set to continue accelerating while novel uses and new possibilities multiply. Given this, we should devote just as much effort to identifying and exploiting new opportunities as we do to identifying and mitigating challenges.In this talk, we begin by discussing several concrete and research-backed opportunities for computing educators. Many of these have already shown great promise in positively impacting current practice. We then discuss more short- to medium-term possibilities in areas such as student recruitment, and curricular changes. Finally - against our better judgement - we speculate over the longer-term, including rethinking the very fundamentals of the practice of teaching introductory and advanced computing courses. In these discussions we suggest potential research questions and directions. Although making remotely accurate predictions in such a fast-changing landscape is foolhardy, we believe that now is the time to explore and embrace opportunities to help make positive change in as many computing classrooms as possible.},

abstract = {Deep learning has achieved great success in numerous application areas at the cost of high computational complexity. To meet the ever-increasing computational demand, commodity hardware platforms (e.g., CPUs and GPUs) offer abundant computing resources including scalar, vector, and tensor units for deep learning that could execute in parallel. However, existing top-down tiling-based deep learning compilers often generate a homogeneous mapping from the given tensor computation task to hardware arithmetic instructions, failing to utilize different computing units simultaneously to achieve higher performance.In this paper, we propose Mosaic, a bottom-up tessellation-based deep learning compiler that directly tessellates the given tensor computation task with varying instructions, forming a heterogeneous instruction-to-task mapping to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP) across different computing units. The key that enables such tessellation is the iTex abstraction, which models the relationship between the instruction operations and its semantics with formalized affine functions. Based on the iTex, we propose a heuristic approach to efficiently generate various tessellation plans. Further, we propose the iTex scheduling technique to orchestrate the execution of instructions, reducing potential structural hazards and maximizing the exploitable ILP. Our extensive evaluation shows that Mosaic achieves an average speedup ranging from 1.08\texttimes{} to 1.28\texttimes{} across multiple hardware platforms compared to highly optimized vendor libraries. Mosaic also achieves an average speedup of 1.34\texttimes{} over the best existing baselines on real-world operators extracted from LLMs. More importantly, Mosaic reaches up to 106% of the GPU Tensor Core theoretical peak throughput, demonstrating its effective exploitation of ILP.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) empowered edge computing has given rise to a new paradigm and effectively facilitated the promotion and development of multimedia applications. The speech assistant is one of the significant services provided by multimedia applications, which aims to offer intelligent interactive experiences between humans and machines. However, malicious attackers may exploit spoofed speeches to deceive speech assistants, posing great challenges to the security of multimedia applications. The limited resources of multimedia terminal devices hinder their ability to effectively load speech spoofing detection models. Furthermore, processing and analyzing speech in the cloud can result in poor real-time performance and potential privacy risks. Existing speech spoofing detection methods rely heavily on annotated data and exhibit poor generalization capabilities for unseen spoofed speeches. To address these challenges, this paper first proposes the Coordinate Attention Network (CA2Net) that consists of coordinate attention blocks and Res2Net blocks. CA2Net can simultaneously extract temporal and spectral speech feature information and represent multi-scale speech features at a granularity level. Besides, a contrastive learning-based speech spoofing detection framework named GEMINI is proposed. GEMINI can be effectively deployed on edge nodes and autonomously learn speech features with strong generalization capabilities. GEMINI first performs data augmentation on speech signals and extracts conventional acoustic features to enhance the feature robustness. Subsequently, GEMINI utilizes the proposed CA2Net to further explore the discriminative speech features. Then, a tensor-based multi-attention comparison model is employed to maximize the consistency between speech contexts. GEMINI continuously updates CA2Net with contrastive learning, which enables CA2Net to effectively represent speech signals and accurately detect spoofed speeches. Extensive experiments on the ASVspoof2019 dataset show that GEMINI reduces the Equal Error Rate and tandem Detection Cost Function by up to 96.75% and 96.35% in the physical access scenario, and by up to 86.62% and 87.71% in the logical access scenario compared to peer methods.},

abstract = {Foundation models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have garnered significant interest from both academia and industry due to their emergent capabilities, such as few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, instruction following, and model calibration. Such capabilities were previously only attainable with specially designed models, such as those using knowledge graphs, but can now be achieved on a much larger scale with foundation models. As the capabilities of foundation models have increased, so too have their sizes at a rate much faster than Moore's law. For example, the BERT large model was initially released as a 334M model in 2018, and by 2023, the largest GPT-4 models are estimated to range between 200-300B, representing an increase of three orders of magnitude in just five years. The training of foundation models requires massive computing power. For instance, training a BERT model on a single state-of-the-art GPU machine with multi-A100 chips can take several days, while training GPT-3 models on a large multi-instance GPU cluster can take several months to complete the estimated 3 X 1023 flops.This tutorial provides an overview of the latest progress in supporting foundation model training and inference with new AI chips. It reviews progress on the modeling side, with an emphasis on the transformer architecture, and presents the system architecture supporting training and serving foundation models. This includes programming language frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, graph compilers, 3D parallelisms, and accelerators such as the GPU H100, TPU, and Trainium. Finally, the tutorial presents our experience of training foundation models using different systems.},

Our objective is to seamlessly integrate quantum computational elements into the conventional GAN architecture, thereby unlocking novel pathways for enhanced training processes. Drawing inspiration from the inherent capabilities of quantum bits (qubits), we delve into the incorporation of quantum data representation methodologies within the GAN framework. By capitalizing on the unique quantum features, we aim to accelerate the training process of GANs, offering a fresh perspective on the optimization of generative models. Our investigation deals with theoretical considerations and evaluates the potential quantum advantages that may manifest in terms of training efficiency and generative quality. We confront the challenges inherent in the quantum-classical amalgamation, addressing issues related to quantum hardware constraints, error correction mechanisms, and scalability considerations. This research is positioned at the forefront of quantum-enhanced machine learning, presenting a critical stride towards harnessing the computational power of quantum systems to expedite the training of Generative Adversarial Networks. Through our comprehensive examination of the interface between classical and quantum realms, we aim to uncover transformative insights that will propel the field forward, fostering innovation and advancing the frontier of quantum machine learning.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancements in multimodal generative technology, Affective Computing research has provoked discussion about the potential consequences of AI systems equipped with emotional intelligence. Affective Computing involves the design, evaluation, and implementation of Emotion AI and related technologies aimed at improving people's lives. Designing a computational model in affective computing requires vast amounts of multimodal data, including RGB images, video, audio, text, and physiological signals. Moreover, Affective Computing research is deeply engaged with ethical considerations at various stages'from training emotionally intelligent models on large-scale human data to deploying these models in specific applications. Fundamentally, the development of any AI system must prioritize its impact on humans, aiming to augment and enhance human abilities rather than replace them, while drawing inspiration from human intelligence in a safe and responsible manner. The MRAC 2024 Track 1 workshop seeks to extend these principles from controlled, small-scale lab environments to real-world, large-scale contexts, emphasizing responsible development. The workshop also aims to highlight the potential implications of generative technology, along with the ethical consequences of its use, to researchers and industry professionals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first workshop series to comprehensively address the full spectrum of multimodal, generative affective computing from a responsible AI perspective, and this is the second iteration of this workshop.

abstract = {Checkpointing is one of the fundamental techniques to resume training while system fails. It has been generally used in various domains, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML). However, as machine learning models increase in size and complexity rapidly, the cost of checkpointing in ML training became a bottleneck in storage and performance (time). For example, the latest GPT-4 model has massive parameters at the scale of 1.76 trillion. It is highly time and storage consuming to frequently writes the model to checkpoints with more than 1 trillion floating point values to storage. This work aims to understand and attempt to mitigate this problem. First, we characterize the checkpointing interface in a collection of representative large machine learning/language models with respect to storage consumption and performance overhead. Second, we propose the two optimizations: i) A periodic cleaning strategy that periodically cleans up outdated checkpoints to reduce the storage burden; ii) A data staging optimization that coordinates checkpoints between local and shared file systems for performance improvement. The experimental results with GPT-2 variants show that, overall the proposed optimizations significantly reduce the storage consumption to a constant while improves performance by average 2.1\texttimes{} for checkpointing in GPT-2 training.},

abstract = {In the wake of the controversy surrounding the new AI chatbot application, ChatGPT, I wonder how Logie would seek to include this new technology in his work. I ponder this because, throughout the book, Logie presents compelling evidence for why the concepts of invention, composition, and internetworked writing should be embraced and not feared. While some denounce the application and take to social media to disparage the possible negative impact on students, creativity, and composition, ChatGPT, I believe Logie would argue, would be a powerful tool we can implement to become "composers." He believes that through cloud computing services we are now more apt to collaborate, use, remix, and create rhetorical modes that extend far beyond the formulaic argument, therefore we are composers. So, Logie applies the idea of a composer as someone who is a "prosumer" (Toffler). This composer is media literate and transforms traditional rhetorical canons into multimodal compositions such as memes, Google Docs, and digital collages. However, his overarching argument is that internetworked writing tools have democratized writing through that same offering of innovative outlets. His book is arranged in a way that walks the reader through this argument.},

abstract = {Neural knowledge models emerged and advanced common-sense-centric knowledge grounding. They parameterize a small seed curated commonsense knowledge graph (CS-KG) in a language model to generalize more. A current trend is to scale the seed up by directly mixing multiple sources of CS-KG (e.g., ATOMIC, ConceptNet) into one model. But, such brute-force mixing inevitably hinders effective knowledge consolidation due to i) ambiguous, polysemic, and/or inconsistent relations across sources and ii) knowledge learned in an entangled manner despite distinct types (e.g., causal, temporal). To mitigate this, we adopt a concept of commonsense knowledge dimension and propose a brand-new dimension-disentangled knowledge model (D2KM) learning paradigm with multiple sources. That is, a generative language model with dimension-specific soft prompts is trained to disentangle knowledge acquisitions along with different dimensions and facilitate potential intra-dimension consolidation across CS-KG sources. Experiments show our knowledge model outperforms its baselines in both standard and zero-shot scenarios.},

abstract = {Indoor scene modification has emerged as a prominent area within computer vision, particularly for its applications in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Traditional methods often rely on pre-existing object databases and predetermined object positions, limiting their flexibility and adaptability to new scenarios. In response to this challenge, we present a novel end-to-end multi-modal deep neural network capable of generating point cloud objects seamlessly integrated with their surroundings, driven by textual instructions. Our work proposes a novel approach in scene modification by enabling the creation of new environments with previously unseen object layouts, eliminating the need for pre-stored CAD models. Leveraging Point-E as our generative model, we introduce innovative techniques such as quantized position prediction and Top-K estimation to address the issue of false negatives resulting from ambiguous language descriptions. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive evaluations to showcase the diversity of generated objects, the efficacy of textual instructions, and the quantitative metrics, affirming the realism and versatility of our model in generating indoor objects. To provide a holistic assessment, we incorporate visual grounding as an additional metric, ensuring the quality and coherence of the scenes produced by our model. Through these advancements, our approach not only advances the state-of-the-art in indoor scene modification but also lays the foundation for future innovations in immersive computing and digital environment creation.

abstract = {This paper critically examines persistent inequities in existing computing faculty hiring and retention practices, which gravely impact computing educators from marginalized groups. Throughout these processes, applicants fight against multiple systemic barriers, including but not limited to, biased job ads and discriminatory interview practices. The increasing use of generative AI tools to aid in tasks connected to the hiring process, such as writing recommendation letters, exacerbates these biases. The inequities persist despite global initiatives and legal mandates and serve as a direct contradiction to widespread institutional commitments to diversity and inclusion. By building on literature and the lived experiences of the SIGCSE community represented in a recent Technical Symposium session, we raise concerns about the different stages of this process, highlighting the importance of clear expectations and adequate support. The paper concludes with a call to align hiring practices with inclusive institutional values, requiring the academic community to reflect on and revise hiring policies for a more equitable future. It is of paramount importance to address the role of these practices in the erosion of marginalized communities from the computing education community, a marginalization that occurs in many different contexts and negatively impacts everyone involved.},

Grounding FMs by adapting them to domain-specific tasks or augmenting them with domain-specific knowledge enables us to exploit the full potential of FMs. However, grounding FMs faces several challenges, stemming primarily from constrained computing resources, data privacy, model heterogeneity, and model ownership. Federated Transfer Learning (FTL), the combination of federated learning and transfer learning, provides promising solutions to address these challenges. Recently, the need for grounding FMs leveraging FTL, coined FTL-FM, has arisen strongly in both academia and industry. Motivated by the strong growth in FTL-FM research and the potential impact of FTL-FM on industrial applications, we propose an FTL-FM framework that formulates problems of grounding FMs in the federated learning setting, construct a detailed taxonomy based on the FTL-FM framework to categorize state-of-the-art FTL-FM works, and comprehensively overview FTL-FM works based on the proposed taxonomy. We also establish correspondence between FTL-FM and conventional phases of adapting FM so that FM practitioners can align their research works with FTL-FM. In addition, we overview advanced efficiency-improving and privacy-preserving techniques because efficiency and privacy are critical concerns in FTL-FM. Last, we discuss opportunities and future research directions of FTL-FM.},

abstract = {LLMs have seen rapid adoption in all domains. They need to be trained on high-end high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures and ingest massive amounts of input data. Unsurprisingly, at such a large scale, unexpected events (e.g., failures of components, instability of the software, undesirable learning patterns, etc.), are frequent and typically impact the training in a negative fashion. Thus, LLMs need to be checkpointed frequently so that they can be rolled back to a stable state and subsequently fine-tuned. However, given the large sizes of LLMs, a straightforward checkpointing solution that directly writes the model parameters and optimizer state to persistent storage (e.g., a parallel file system), incurs significant I/O overheads. To address this challenge, in this paper we study how to reduce the I/O overheads for enabling fast and scalable checkpointing for LLMs that can be applied at high frequency (up to the granularity of individual iterations) without significant impact on the training process. Specifically, we introduce a lazy asynchronous multi-level approach that takes advantage of the fact that the tensors making up the model and optimizer state shards remain immutable for extended periods of time, which makes it possible to copy their content in the background with minimal interference during the training process. We evaluate our approach at scales of up to 180 GPUs using different model sizes, parallelism settings, and checkpointing frequencies. The results show up to 48\texttimes{} faster checkpointing and 2.2\texttimes{} faster end-to-end training runtime compared with the state-of-art checkpointing approaches.},

Surprisingly, user interfaces, the gateways to these systems, largely lack hedonic aspects. There is little attempt to intentionally make communication through user interfaces more like communication with humans. Anthropomorphic user interfaces, which integrate human-like attributes, can make interactions more pleasant and intuitive by allowing users to perceive and interact with interfaces as social actors. This enhances user experience, reduces the learning curve, and boosts adaption rates, but also holds the potential to make interfaces more sustainable, as they rely on familiar human interaction patterns. However, there is little consensus on how to build such interfaces. We conducted an extensive literature review on existing anthropomorphic user interfaces for software systems (past) to map and connect existing definitions and interpretations in an overarching taxonomy (present). The taxonomy and an accompanying web tool provide designers with a reference framework for analyzing and dissecting existing anthropomorphic user interfaces and designing new ones (future).},

We first present GANspire, a deep learning tool that generates fine-grained breathing waveforms, which we crafted in collaboration with one respiratory physician, attending to joint materialities of human breathing data and deep generative models. We then relate a probe, produced with breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, and led with a group of ten respiratory care experts, responding to its material attributes. Qualitative annotations showed that respiratory care experts interpreted both realistic and ambiguous attributes of breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, according to subjective aspects of physiology, activity and emotion. Semi-structured interviews also revealed experts' broader perceptions, expectations and ethical concerns on AI technology, based on their clinical practice of respiratory care, and reflexive analysis of GANspire. These findings suggest design implications for technological aids in respiratory care, and show how ambiguity of deep generative models can be leveraged as a resource for qualitative inquiry, enabling socio-material research with generative deep learning. Our paper contributes to the CSCW community by broadening how generative deep learning may be approached not only as a tool to design human-computer interactions, but also as a probe to provoke open conversations with communities of practice about their current and speculative uses of AI technology.},

abstract = {Leveraging serverless computing for cloud-based machine learning services is on the rise, promising cost-efficiency and flexibility are crucial for ML applications relying on high-performance GPUs and substantial memory. However, despite modern serverless platforms handling diverse devices like GPUs seamlessly on a pay-as-you-go basis, a longstanding challenge remains: startup latency, a well-studied issue when serverless is CPU-centric. For example, initializing GPU apps with minor GPU models, like MobileNet, demands several seconds. For more intricate models such as GPT-2, startup latency can escalate to around 10 seconds, vastly overshadowing the short computation time for GPU-based inference. Prior solutions tailored for CPU serverless setups, like fork() and Checkpoint/Restore, cannot be directly and effectively applied due to differences between CPUs and GPUs.This paper presents gCROP (GPU Checkpoint/Restore made On-demand and Parallel), the first GPU runtime that achieves &lt;100ms startup latency for GPU apps with up to 774 million parameters (3.1GB GPT-2-Large model). The key insight behind gCROP is to selectively restore essential states on demand and in parallel during boot from a prepared checkpoint image. To this end, gCROP first introduces a global service, GPU Restore Server, which can break the existing barrier between restore stages and achieve parallel restore. Besides, gCROP leverages both CPU and GPU page faults, and can on-demand restore both CPU and GPU data with profile-guided order to mitigate costs caused by faults. Moreover, gCROP designs a multi-checkpoint mechanism to increase the common contents among checkpoint images and utilizes deduplication to reduce storage costs. Implementation and evaluations on AMD GPUs show significant improvement in startup latency, 6.4x-24.7x compared with booting from scratch and 3.9x-23.5x over the state-of-the-art method (CRIU).},

Modern RL algorithms, i.e., Deep Q-Learning, are based on costly and resource hungry deep neural networks. This motivates us to deploy alternative models for powering RL agents on edge devices. Recently, brain-inspired Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution for lightweight and efficient machine learning, particularly for classification.In this work, we develop a novel platform capable of real-time hyperdimensional reinforcement learning. Our heterogeneous CPU-FPGA platform, called DARL, maximizes FPGA's computing capabilities by applying hardware optimizations to hyperdimensional computing's critical operations, including hardware-friendly encoder IP, the hypervector chunk fragmentation, and the delayed model update. Aside from hardware innovation, we also extend the platform to basic single-agent RL to support multi-agents distributed learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on OpenAI Gym tasks. Our results show that the FPGA platform provides on average 20\texttimes{} speedup compared to current state-of-the-art hyperdimensional RL methods running on Intel Xeon 6226 CPU. In addition, DARL provides around 4.8\texttimes{} faster and 4.2\texttimes{} higher energy efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art RL accelerator while ensuring a better or comparable quality of learning.},

abstract = {Transformers have revolutionized deep learning and generative modeling, enabling advancements in natural language processing tasks. However, the size of transformer models is increasing continuously, driven by enhanced capabilities across various deep learning tasks. This trend of ever-increasing model size has given rise to new challenges in terms of memory and compute requirements. Conventional computing platforms, including GPUs, suffer from suboptimal performance due to the memory demands imposed by models with millions/billions of parameters. The emerging chiplet-based platforms provide a new avenue for compute- and data-intensive machine learning applications enabled by a Network-on-Interposer (NoI). However, designing suitable hardware accelerators for executing Transformer inference workloads is challenging due to a wide variety of complex computing kernels in the Transformer architecture. In this article, we leverage chiplet-based heterogeneous integration to design a high-performance and energy-efficient multichiplet platform to accelerate transformer workloads. We demonstrate that the proposed NoI architecture caters to the data access patterns inherent in a transformer model. The optimized placement of the chiplets and the associated NoI links and routers enable superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art hardware accelerators. The proposed NoI-based architecture demonstrates scalability across varying transformer models and improves latency and energy efficiency by up to 11.8\texttimes{} and 2.36\texttimes{}, respectively when compared with the existing state-of-the-art architecture HAIMA.},

abstract = {Edge servers and mobile devices are often assigned a large number of computing tasks. However, the data involved in computing tasks is often sensitive in terms of privacy. Our initial proposal is a federated edge learning strategy based on real-world scenarios, which combines blurred data or pseudo shared data. Federated learning is used to train device models with the aim of protecting privacy while enabling mobile devices to more effectively utilize data for decision-making. In the case of limited energy on mobile devices, we propose a federated edge learning algorithm with blurred data sharing. This algorithm can generate more accurate models by uploading partially blurred data. In order to further improve model accuracy and protect privacy of mobile devices, we propose a federated edge learning algorithm with pseudo data sharing based on dataset distillation and generative adversarial networks (GANs) in scenarios with relatively sufficient energy. The experimental results on several traditional datasets show that our proposed algorithms outperform traditional algorithms in terms of accuracy and energy consumption.},

abstract = {Web is increasingly becoming the primary platform to deliver AI services onto edge devices, making in-browser deep learning (DL) inference more prominent. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of edge devices, combined with the underdeveloped state of Web hardware acceleration practices, hinders current in-browser inference from achieving its full performance potential on target devices.To address this issue, this paper presents the pioneering inbrowser inference system, nnJIT, which enables just-in-time (JIT) auto-generation of optimized computing kernels for edge devices. nnJIT is built upon two novel techniques that significantly reduce kernel search and compilation overhead while improving performance firmly: Tensor-Web Compiling Co-Design lowers compiling costs by around 100\texttimes{} through eliminating redundant and ineffective compiling passes; Web-Specific Lite Kernel Optimization Space reduces kernel tuning costs by focusing on Web programming requirements and efficient device resource utilization, pruning the optimization space from millions to only dozens.nnJIT1 is evaluated for modern models, e.g., BART, T5, and Llama 2, on a range of edge devices including laptops and smartphones using different browsers and hardware from ARM, Intel, AMD and Nvidia. The results show that nnJIT can achieve up to 8.2\texttimes{} faster within 30 seconds compared to the existing baselines.},

abstract = {We propose local symplectic surgery, a two-timescale procedure for finding local Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. We first show that previous gradient-based algorithms cannot guarantee convergence to local Nash equilibria due to the existence of non-Nash stationary points. By taking advantage of the differential structure of the game, we construct an algorithm for which the local Nash equilibria are the only attracting fixed points. Further, we show that the algorithm exhibits no oscillatory behavior in neighborhoods of equilibria and that it has the same per-iteration complexity as other recently proposed algorithms. Furthermore we give convergence rates in structured classes of zero-sum games. We conclude by validating the algorithm on two numerical examples: a toy example with multiple Nash equilibria and a non-Nash equilibrium, and the training of a small generative adversarial network (GAN).Problem statementWe study the problem of computing a (local) Nash equilibrium in non-convex non-concave zero-sum games, i.e., saddle point problems. The majority of work on solving this class of optimization problems makes strong assumptions on the curvature of the underlying functions and consequently the algorithms tend to fail when deployed in unstructured settings like the training of generative adversarial networks.MethodsWe present a new gradient-based algorithm for finding the local Nash equilibria of two-player zero-sum games: local symplectic surgery. Our algorithm makes essential use of the underlying structure of zero-sum games. To derive our algorithm, we work in continuous time-via an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-and our algorithm is obtained via a discretization of the ODE.  While a naive discretization would require a matrix inversion and would be computationally burdensome, our discretization is a two-timescale discretization that avoids matrix inversion entirely and is of a similar computational complexity as that of other gradient-based algorithms.ResultsWe show how-by design- our proposed algorithm overcomes many of the challenges faced by existing methods for computing local Nash equilibria of non-convex non-concave zero-sum games. In particular we
prove that the only stationary points to which the algorithm can converge are local Nash equilibria and further that it cannot exhibit oscillations around equilibrium points-two properties that existing methods fail to guarantee. Furthermore we show numerically  that our algorithm scales gracefully to complex problems like the training of generative adversarial networks and exhibits more stable behavior than existing methods.SignificanceThis paper focuses on the problem of computing solutions to a non-convex non-concave min-max problems that have particular second-order structure: that of a local Nash equilibrium. We show that existing methods for computing saddle points in such games have no guarantees over the types of solutions they converge to-potentially yielding undesired solutions. To overcome this, we propose a new algorithm-local symplectic surgery- which has strong convergence guarantees even in the unstructured settings that often arise in deep learning. Altogether, our insights and algorithms highlight important new problems and present initial solutions to an important problems in an increasingly important subfield of optimization in machine learning.},

abstract = {Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a critical role in human-computer interaction and affective computing. Traditional FER methods typically rely on comparing the difference between an examined facial expression and a neutral face of the same person to extract the motion of facial features and filter out expression-irrelevant information. With the extensive use of deep learning, the performance of FER has been further improved. However, existing deep learning-based methods rarely utilize neutral faces. To address this gap, we propose a novel deep learning-based FER method called Generative Neutral Features-Disentangled Learning (GNDL), which draws inspiration from the facial feature manifold. Our approach integrates a neutral feature generator (NFG) that generates neutral features in scenarios where the neutral face of the same subject is not available. The NFG uses fine-grained features from examined images as input and produces corresponding neutral features with the same identity. We train the NFG using a neutral feature reconstruction loss to ensure that the generative neutral features are consistent with the actual neutral features. We then disentangle the generative neutral features from the examined features to remove disturbance features and generate an expression deviation embedding for classification. Extensitive experimental results on three popular databases (CK+, Oulu-CASIA, and MMI) demonstrate that our proposed GNDL method outperforms state-of-the-art FER methods.},

Existing approaches mainly focus on isometric and near-isometric shape pairs (e.g., human vs. human), but less attention has been given to strongly non-isometric and inter-class shape matching (e.g., human vs. cow). To this end, we introduce a fully automatic method that exploits the exceptional reasoning capabilities of recent foundation models in language and vision to tackle difficult shape correspondence problems. Our approach comprises multiple stages. First, we classify the 3D shapes in a zero-shot manner by feeding rendered shape views to a language-vision model (e.g., BLIP2) to generate a list of class proposals per shape. These proposals are unified into a single class per shape by employing the reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT. Second, we attempt to segment the two shapes in a zero-shot manner, but in contrast to the co-segmentation problem, we do not require a mutual set of semantic regions. Instead, we propose to exploit the in-context learning capabilities of ChatGPT to generate two different sets of semantic regions for each shape and a semantic mapping between them. This enables our approach to match strongly non-isometric shapes with significant differences in geometric structure. Finally, we employ the generated semantic mapping to produce coarse correspondences that can further be refined by the functional maps framework to produce dense point-to-point maps. Our approach, despite its simplicity, produces highly plausible results in a zero-shot manner, especially between strongly non-isometric shapes.},

abstract = {Meshes are ubiquitous in visual computing and simulation, yet most existing machine learning techniques represent meshes only indirectly, e.g. as the level set of a scalar field or deformation of a template, or as a disordered triangle soup lacking local structure. This work presents a scheme to directly generate manifold, polygonal meshes of complex connectivity as the output of a neural network. Our key innovation is to define a continuous latent connectivity space at each mesh vertex, which implies the discrete mesh. In particular, our vertex embeddings generate cyclic neighbor relationships in a halfedge mesh representation, which gives a guarantee of edge-manifoldness and the ability to represent general polygonal meshes. This representation is well-suited to machine learning and stochastic optimization, without restriction on connectivity or topology. We first explore the basic properties of this representation, then use it to fit distributions of meshes from large datasets. The resulting models generate diverse meshes with tessellation structure learned from the dataset population, with concise details and high-quality mesh elements. In applications, this approach not only yields high-quality outputs from generative models, but also enables directly learning challenging geometry processing tasks such as mesh repair.},

abstract = {Owing to the increase in computing power, large-scale agent-based modeling (ABM) has been increasingly used in various fields. However, a complete and detailed individual population is challenging to obtain because of confidentiality concerns. Thus, modelers must adopt population synthesis to emulate the joint distribution of individual-level attributes of the actual population in the region of interest. Traditional population synthesis methods often exhibit issues regarding scalability and sampling zero. Therefore, this paper presents the use of a deep generative model called the denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate new samples. Our proposed method uses the characteristics of deep generative model of generation from noise to generate a synthetic population, including sampling zero. In the experimental results, the standardized root mean squared error of our proposed model performed 2.130, which outperformed 2.381 of the deep learning-based population synthesis method, VAE, and 7.620 of the traditional population synthesis method, MCMC.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly increased AI processors' energy consumption, which is becoming a critical factor limiting AI development. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) stands as a key method in power optimization. However, due to the latency of DVFS control in AI processors, previous works typically apply DVFS control at the granularity of a program's entire duration or sub-phases, rather than at the level of AI operators.The advent of millisecond-level DVFS capabilities on the latest Ascend NPU platforms enables us to set frequency individually for single or multiple operators, opening up the opportunity for further enhancing energy efficiency through fine-grained DVFS control. To ensure performance is unaffected in DVFS, our work builds performance and power models for each operator. Through in-depth timeline analysis, we demonstrate that the cycle count of an operator can be modeled as a convex piecewise linear function of frequency, resulting in a performance model with an average error of 1.96%. Moreover, we build power models that incorporate temperature-dependent terms, which enhances the model's precision and results in an average error of 4.62%.Based on our performance and power models as well as the fine-grained DVFS functionality of Ascend NPU, we propose a DVFS strategy that integrates operator classification, preprocessing, and a genetic algorithm-based search. Experiments on applications including GPT-3 training achieve a reduction in AICore (the computing component within the Ascend NPU) power by 13.44% and NPU chip power by 4.95%, while limiting performance degradation to 1.76%.},

abstract = {Generally speaking, we can easily specify many causal relationships in the prediction tasks of ubiquitous computing, such as human activity prediction, mobility prediction, and health prediction. However, most of the existing methods in these fields failed to take advantage of this prior causal knowledge. They typically make predictions only based on correlations in the data, which hinders the prediction performance in real-world scenarios, because a distribution shift between training data and testing data generally exists. To fill in this gap, we proposed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based Causal Information Learning prediction framework, which can effectively leverage causal information to improve the prediction performance of existing ubiquitous computing deep learning models. Specifically, faced with a unique challenge that the treatment variable, referring to the intervention that influences the target in a causal relationship, is generally continuous in ubiquitous computing, the framework employs a representation learning approach with a GAN-based deep learning model. By projecting all variables except the treatment into a latent space, it effectively minimizes confounding bias and leverages the learned latent representation for accurate predictions. In this way, it deals with the continuous treatment challenge, and in the meantime, it can be easily integrated with existing deep learning models to lift their prediction performance in practical scenarios with causal information. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate its superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art baselines. We also propose an analytical framework together with extensive experiments to empirically show that our framework achieves better performance gain under two conditions: when the distribution differences between the training data and the testing data are more significant and when the treatment effects are larger. Overall, this work suggests that learning causal information is a promising way to improve the prediction performance of ubiquitous computing tasks. We open both our dataset and code1 and call for more research attention in this area.},

abstract = {Continual learning without catastrophic forgetting of previous experiences is an open general challenge for artificial neural networks, but is especially under-explored for artificial neural networks suitable to implement on neuromorphic platforms. An algorithmic understanding of how continual learning occurs in biological neural networks can inform solutions for artificial neural networks, especially in neuromorphic platforms whose biomimetic computing architectures lend themselves to more biofidelic algorithms. In this work, we derive an approach for generative-replay-based continual learning with a three-factor local learning rule based on recurrent connectivity in the insect's memory center, and characterize the model with a CIFAR-100 class incremental continual learning task. First, we investigate the properties of the model's internal representations and find that the high dimensional sparse representations enable this form of generative replay, and that these representations can be binary as required on spiking neuromorphic platforms with little detriment to model performance. Next, we derive a three-factor local learning rule by introducing simplifying assumptions to network updates from error backpropagation optimization which makes the learning rule biologically plausible (i.e., without weight transport) and amenable to neuromorphic implementation. Finally, we find that these simplifications enhance performance during gradient-based optimization for continual learning and when implemented locally achieve this increased performance. Overall, the outcomes of this work can inform a more detailed understanding for continual learning in this biological circuit, as well as introduce general approaches for neuromorphic continual learning.},

abstract = {To evaluate novel solutions for edge computing systems, suitable distribution models for simulation are essential. The extensive use of deep learning (DL) in video analytics has altered traffic patterns on edge and cloud servers, necessitating innovative models. Queuing models are used to simulate the performance and stability of edge-enabled systems, particularly video streaming applications. This paper demonstrates that traditional Markovian M/M/s and general distribution G/G/s queuing models must be revamped for accurate simulation. We examined these queuing models by characterizing the real data with discrete and continuous distributions for arrival rates to homogenous servers in AI-based video analytics edge systems. Based on achieved results, traditional methods for finding general distributions are inadequate, and an automation method for finding empirical distribution is needed. Therefore, we introduce a novel approach using a generative adversarial network (WGAN) to generate artificial data to automate the process of estimating empirical distribution for modeling these applications.},

abstract = {The remarkable advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has driven revolutionary applications for text-to-image generation, like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Especially, the diffusion model can generate stunning images from natural language descriptions by using a reverse continuous denoising process. However, the computation burden of diffusion model-based GenAI services poses a significant hurdle for their practical implementation. In this work, we propose a novel edge computing-assisted GenAI framework to enable efficient GenAI service provision, where the intermediate output generated by diffusion models can be cached on edge servers and reused by various users to improve edge computing resource utilization. Assuming the existence of causally correlated auxiliary information, a long-term caching problem is formulated under intra-time-slot caching constraints by considering various maximally reusable steps of diffusion model-based GenAI tasks and the available caching capacity at edge servers. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization framework, we transform the time-average caching problem into several deterministic problems for different time slots. We develop a deep reinforcement learning-based caching (DRC) algorithm to obtain caching decisions in each time slot, where a deep neural network (DNN)-based caching action generation module and a model-based evaluation module are designed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments by comparing the DRC algorithm with benchmark algorithms. The simulation results depict that the proposed DRC algorithm can reduce response time and improve cache hit rates significantly. The code is available at https://gitee.com/pipihinsky/DRC.},

abstract = {With the wide application of deep learning and the explosion of generative AI, the efficient implementation of model reasoning has attracted wide attention. How to conduct efficient model reasoning on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones or embedded development boards has been discussed. In such devices, the performance of conventional general computing devices such as CPUs or GPUs will not be the same as that of supercomputers with massive computing resources, and the use of traditional computing resources of such devices for model reasoning is often not satisfactory in time. In this paper, we introduce a high-performance deep learning inference library, MHInfer. This reasoning library is written in traditional C language, and retains the interface of device acceleration, which is convenient for device acceleration of model reasoning later. In this paper, we deploy the inference library to the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 embedded development board, which has a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and FPGA acceleration device, and runs an embedded domestic operating system on the ARM CPU. Control the data transmission between the host and the FPGA device. In the test, we will compare the speed of CPU and CPU+FPGA heterogeneous platform on the development board respectively. The results show that when using our high-performance reasoning library, the efficiency of computing on CPU+FPGA heterogeneous platform is greatly improved than that of using only CPU.},

Synthesized images can be used to improve the robustness of computer-aided diagnosis systems. However, GANs are difficult to train due to unstable training dynamics that may arise during the learning process, e.g., mode collapse and vanishing gradients. This paper focuses on Lipizzaner, a GAN training framework that combines spatial coevolution with gradient-based learning, which has been used to mitigate GAN training pathologies. Lipizzaner improves performance by taking advantage of its distributed nature and running at scale. Thus, the Lipizzaner algorithm and implementation robustness can be scaled to high-performance computing (HPC) systems to provide more accurate generative models. We address medical imaging data augmentation to create chest X-Ray images by using Lipizzaner on the HPC infrastructure provided by Oak Ridge National Labs' Summit Supercomputer. The experimental analysis shows improved performance by increasing the scale of the Lipizzaner GAN training. We also demonstrate that distributed coevolutionary learning improves performance even when using suboptimal neural network architectures due to hardware constraints.},

MIoT’s integration of physical and computational components creates a seamless network of medical devices providing high-quality care via continuous monitoring and treatment. However, traditional security methods such as cryptography cannot prevent privacy compromise and information leakage caused by security breaches. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel Federated Learning Intrusion Detection System (FLIDS). FLIDS combines Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Federated Learning (FL) to detect cyber attacks like Denial of Service (DoS), data modification, and data injection using machine learning. FLIDS shows exceptional performance with over 99% detection accuracy and 1% False Positive Rate (FPR). It saves bandwidth by transmitting 3.8 times fewer bytes compared to central data collection. These results prove FLIDS’ effectiveness in detecting and mitigating security threats in Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). The paper recommends scaling up FLIDS to use computing resources from multiple mobile devices for better intrusion detection accuracy and efficiency while reducing the burden on individual devices in MIoT.},

abstract = {Recently Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has become a promising solution to achieve energy-efficient computation in data-intensive applications by placing computation near or inside the memory. In most Deep Learning (DL) frameworks, a user manually partitions a model’s computational graph (CG) onto the computing devices by considering the devices’ capability and the data transfer. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) models become increasingly complex for improving accuracy; thus, it is exceptionally challenging to partition the execution to achieve the best performance, especially on a PIM-based platform requiring frequent offloading of large amounts of data. This article proposes two novel algorithms for DL inference to resolve the challenge: low-overhead profiling and optimal model partitioning. First, we reconstruct CG by considering the devices’ capability to represent all the possible scheduling paths. Second, we develop a profiling algorithm to find the required minimum profiling paths to measure all the node and edge costs of the reconstructed CG. Finally, we devise the model partitioning algorithm to get the optimal minimum execution time using the dynamic programming technique with the profiled data. We evaluated our work by executing the BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 models on the ARM multicores with the PIM-modeled FPGA platform with various sequence lengths. For three computing devices in the platform, i.e., CPU serial/parallel and PIM executions, we could find all the costs only in four profile runs, three for node costs and one for edge costs. Also, our model partitioning algorithm achieved the highest performance in all the experiments over the execution with manually assigned device priority and the state-of-the-art greedy approach.},

Variational autoencoder is one of the computer-aided design methods which explores the chemical space based on an existing molecular dataset. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an atypical learning method that may speed up some classical learning tasks because of its strong expressive power. However, near-term quantum computers suffer from limited number of qubits which hinders the representation learning in high dimensional spaces. We present a scalable quantum generative autoencoder (SQ-VAE) for simultaneously reconstructing and sampling drug molecules, and a corresponding vanilla variant (SQ-AE) for better reconstruction. The architectural strategies in hybrid quantum classical networks such as, adjustable quantum layer depth, heterogeneous learning rates, and patched quantum circuits are proposed to learn high dimensional dataset such as, ligand-targeted drugs. Extensive experimental results are reported for different dimensions including 8x8 and 32x32 after choosing suitable architectural strategies. The performance of quantum generative autoencoder is compared with the corresponding classical counterpart throughout all experiments. The results show that quantum computing advantages can be achieved for normalized low-dimension molecules, and that high-dimension molecules generated from quantum generative autoencoders have better drug properties within the same learning period.},

abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence works typically train the parameters of fixed-sized deep neural networks using gradient-based optimization techniques. Simple evolutionary algorithms have recently been shown to also be capable of optimizing deep neural network parameters, at times matching the performance of gradient-based techniques, e.g. in reinforcement learning settings. In addition to optimizing network parameters, many evolutionary computation techniques are also capable of progressively constructing network architectures. However, constructing network architectures from elementary evolution rules has not yet been shown to scale to modern reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this paper we therefore propose a new approach in which the architectures of recurrent neural networks dynamically evolve according to a small set of mutation rules. We implement a massively parallel evolutionary algorithm and run experiments on all 19 OpenAI Gym state-based reinforcement learning control tasks. We find that in the majority of cases, dynamic agents match or exceed the performance of gradient-based agents while utilizing orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We believe our work to open avenues for real-life applications where network compactness and autonomous design are of critical importance. We provide our source code, final model checkpoints and full results at github.com/MaximilienLC/nra.Artificial neural networks are computing systems that have become central to the field of artificial intelligence. Through waves of innovation, these networks have gotten bigger, more efficient, and increasingly competent on a wide range of tasks. Most often, the parameters of these artificial neural networks are optimized using first-order gradient-based optimization techniques, yet their architecture is for the most part still constructed manually.},

abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8% of worldwide carbon emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of data centers. In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready Mix—a concrete supplier—to generate field-ready concrete formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design. Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of buildings and structures in a Meta data center in DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from field experiments as part of this real-world deployment corroborate the efficacy of AI-generated low-carbon concrete mixes.},

abstract = {Semantic image synthesis aims to generate images from given semantic layouts, which is a challenging task that requires training models to capture the relationship between layouts and images. Previous works are usually based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or autoregressive (AR) models. However, the GAN model's training process is unstable, and the AR model’s performance is seriously affected by the independent image encoder and the unidirectional generation bias. Due to the above limitations, these methods tend to synthesize unrealistic, poorly aligned images and only consider single-style image generation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-model Style-aware Diffusion Learning (MSDL) framework for semantic image synthesis, including a training module and a sampling module. In the training module, a layout-to-image model is introduced to transfer the learned knowledge from a model pretrained with massive weak correlated text-image pairs data, making the training process more efficient. In the sampling module, we designed a map-guidance technique and creatively designed a multi-model style-guidance strategy for creating images in multiple styles, e.g., oil painting, Disney Cartoon, and pixel style. We evaluate our method on Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO-Stuff, making visual comparisons and computing with multiple metrics such as FID, LPIPS, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is highly competitive, especially in terms of fidelity and diversity.},

This property enables VI to be faster than several sampling-based techniques. However, the traditional VI algorithm is not scalable to large data sets and is unable to readily infer out-of-bounds data points without re-running the optimization process. Recent developments in the field, like stochastic-, black box-, and amortized-VI, have helped address these issues. Generative modeling tasks nowadays widely make use of amortized VI for its efficiency and scalability, as it utilizes a parameterized function to learn the approximate posterior density parameters. In this paper, we review the mathematical foundations of various VI techniques to form the basis for understanding amortized VI. Additionally, we provide an overview of the recent trends that address several issues of amortized VI, such as the amortization gap, generalization issues, inconsistent representation learning, and posterior collapse. Finally, we analyze alternate divergence measures that improve VI optimization.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, AI bias has become a central concern within design and computing fields. But as the concept of bias has grown in visibility, its meaning and form have become harder to grasp. To help designers realize bias, we take inspiration from textile bias (the skew of woven material) and examine the topic across its myriad forms: visual, textual, and tactile. By introducing a slanted experience of material and therefore of reality, we explore the translation of fraught machine learning algorithms into personal and probing artifacts. In this pictorial, we present nine pieces that materialize complex relationships with machine learning; ground these relationships in the present and the personal; and point to generative ways of engaging with biased systems around us.},

abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) in EDA is a hot research trend. To use ML in EDA, it is nature to think from the ML method point of view, i.e. supervised learning, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning. Based on this point of view, we can roughly classify the ML applications in EDA into three categories: prediction, optimization, and generation. The prediction category applies supervised learning methods to predict design quality of result (QoR) metrics. There are two kinds of QoR metrics that benefit from the prediction. One kind of metrics are those that can be determined at the current design stage but calculating them consumes a lot of computing resources. For ex-ample, [11] [12] leverage ML to predict circuit power consumption without expensive simulations. The other kind of metrics are those that depend on future design stages. For example, [8] predicts post layout parasitics from schematic of analog circuits. The optimization category applies Bayesian Optimization (BO)and reinforcement learning (RL) to directly optimize EDA problems.BO treats the optimization objective as a blackbox function and tries to find optimal solutions by iteratively sampling the solution space. For example, [5] proposes to use BO with graph embedding and neural network-based surrogate model to size analog circuits. RL treats the optimization objective as the reward from an environment, and trains agents to maximize the reward. [7] proposes to use RL to optimize macro placement, and [9] proposes to use RL to optimize parallel prefix circuit structures. The generation category applies generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) to directly generate solutions to EDA problems. Generative models can learn from previous optimized data distribution and generate solutions for a new problem instance without going through iterative processes like BO or RL. For example, [10] builds a conditional GAN model that learns to generate optical proximity correction (OPC) layout from the original mask.},

abstract = {As diverse high-performance computing (HPC) systems are built, many opportunities arise for applications to solve larger problems than ever before. Given the significantly increased complexity of these HPC systems and application tuning, empirical performance tuning, such as autotuning, has emerged as a promising approach in recent years. Despite its effectiveness, autotuning is often a computationally expensive approach. Transfer learning (TL)-based autotuning seeks to address this issue by leveraging the data from prior tuning. Current TL methods for autotuning spend significant time modeling the relationship between parameter configurations and performance, which is ineffective for few-shot (that is, few empirical evaluations) tuning on new tasks. We introduce the first generative TL-based autotuning approach based on the Gaussian copula (GC) to model the high-performing regions of the search space from prior data and then generate high-performing configurations for new tasks. This allows a sampling-based approach that maximizes few-shot performance and provides the first probabilistic estimation of the few-shot budget for effective TL-based autotuning. We compare our generative TL approach with state-of-the-art autotuning techniques on several benchmarks. We find that the GC is capable of achieving 64.37% of peak few-shot performance in its first evaluation. Furthermore, the GC model can determine a few-shot transfer budget that yields up to 33.39\texttimes{} speedup, a dramatic improvement over the 20.58\texttimes{} speedup using prior techniques.},

abstract = {Designing algorithms for continuous control is a big challenge no matter in real robot controlling or simulation tasks. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the most successful algorithm in dealing with such tasks for it utilizing the powerful ability of deep neuron network (DNN) in handling complex information. However, the more powerful ability the DNN has, the more energy it consumes. It’s a barrier for DRL to be realized in real-world control tasks. With more biological features, spiking neuron network (SNN) is one of the frontier fields of high-efficiency computing. The binary spike it used to represent information contains more temporal information and leads to greater computational efficiency on neuromorphic chips. Based on a hybrid architecture of SNN and DNN, we propose an actor-critic model to utilize the ability of SNN in dealing with complex continuous information and the ability of DNN in large scale accurate computation. The common Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model which is mainly used to build deep SNN neglects the resistance flexibility in the neuron. Considering that causes a descend capacity of representing continuous information which is of vital important in continuous control, we propose a new dynamic resistance LIF (R-LIF) model to compensate the temporal relation dependencies in neurons. With the same gradient updating rule, our R-LIF based spiking actor network (RSAN) shows a better performance when inferring in OpenAI benchmark tasks not only than the deep neuron actor network but also than the same LIF based spiking neuron actor network.},

abstract = {Hand-based gestural interaction in augmented reality (AR) is an increasingly popular mechanism for spatial interactions. However, it presents many challenges. For example, most hand gesture interactions work well for interactions with virtual content and interfaces, but seldom work with physical devices and users’ environment. To explore this, and rather than inventing new paradigms for AR interactions, this paper revisits Zigelbaum, Kumpf, Vazquez, and Ishii’s 2008 project ‘Slurp’ [72] - a physical eyedropper to interact with digital content from IoT devices. We revive this historical work in a new modality of AR through a five step process: re-presecencing, design experimentation, scenario making, expansion through generative engagements with designers, and reflection. For the designers we engaged, looking back and designing with a restored prototype helped increased understanding of interactive strategies, intentions and rationales of original work. By revisiting Slurp, we also found many new potentials of its metaphorical interactions that could be applied in the context of emerging spatial computing platforms (e.g., smart home devices). In doing so, we discuss the value of mining past works in new domains and demonstrate a new way of thinking about designing interactions in emerging platforms.},

abstract = {The need for 3D and 4D (i.e., 3D + time) shape analysis arises in many branches of science ranging from anatomy, bioinformatics, medicine, and biology to computer graphics, multimedia, and virtual and augmented reality. In fact, shape is an essential property of natural and man-made 3D objects. It deforms over time as a result of many internal and external factors. For instance, anatomical organs such as bones, kidneys, and subcortical structures in the brain deform due to natural growth or disease progression; human faces deform as a consequence of talking, executing facial expressions, and aging. Similarly, human body actions and motions such as walking, jumping, and grasping are the result of the deformation, over time, of the human body shape. The ability to understand and model (1) the typical shape and deformation patterns of a class of 3D objects, and (2) the variability of these shapes and deformations within and across object classes has many applications. For example, in medical diagnosis and biological growth modeling, one is interested in measuring the intensity of pain from facial deformations, and in distinguishing between normal growth and disease progression using the shape of the body and its deformation over time. In computer vision and graphics, the ability to statistically model such spatiotemporal variability can be used to summarize collections of 3D objects and their animation, and simulate animations and motions. Similar to 3D morphable models, these tools can also be used in a generative model for synthesizing large corpora of labeled longitudinal 3D shape data, e.g., 4D faces, virtual humans, and various objects. In this talk, I will share the research undertaken by my group and collaborators in the area of statistical analysis and modelling of static (i.e., 3D) and dynamic (i.e., 4D) shapes. I will first highlight the importance of this topic for various applications ranging from biology and medicine to computer graphics and virtual/augmented reality. I will then structure my talk into three parts. The first one focuses on 3D shapes that bend, stretch, and change in topology. I will introduce our mathematical framework, termed Square Normal Fields (SRNF) [6, 10-12, 15], which provides (1) an efficient representation of 3D shapes, (2) an elastic metric for quantifying shape differences between objects, (3) mechanisms for computing correspondences and geodesics between such shapes, and (4) methods for characterizing populations of 3D shapes using generative models. I will consider both shapes that bend and stretch [6, 10-12, 15] but also those that change their structure and topology [18-22]. The second part of the talk will focus on 4D shapes, i.e., 3D shapes that move and deform as the result of normal growth or disease progression [9, 14]. I will summarize the latest solutions we developed for the statistical analysis of the spatio-temporal variability in such 4D shape data and highlight their applications in various fields. The third part of this talk will focus on the role statistical 3D and 4D shape models played and have to play in the era of Deep Learning and Generative AI. I will particularly highlight their importance and the role they played in advancing the field of 3D and 4D reconstruction and generation from images, videos, and text [1-5, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17]. I will conclude the talk by sharing insights into potential future developments in and applications of statistical 3D and 4D shape models.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) allows several data owners to train a joint model without sharing their training data. Such a paradigm is useful for better privacy in many ubiquitous computing systems. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious participants attempt to inject a backdoor task in the model at training time, along with the main task that the model was initially trained for. Recent works show that FL is particularly vulnerable to edge-case backdoors introduced by data points with unusual out-of-distribution features. Such attacks are among the most difficult to counter, and today's FL defense mechanisms usually fail to tackle them. In this paper, we present ARMOR, a defense mechanism that leverages adversarial learning to uncover edge-case backdoors. In contrast to most of existing FL defenses, ARMOR does not require real data samples and is compatible with secure aggregation, thus, providing better FL privacy protection. ARMOR relies on GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to extract data features from model updates, and uses the generated samples to test the activation of potential edge-case backdoors in the model. Our experimental evaluations with three widely used datasets and neural networks show that ARMOR can tackle edge-case backdoors with 95% resilience against attacks, and without hurting model quality.},

abstract = {The convergence of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming numerical simulations across various scientific domains. In reactive flow simulations, deep learning (DL) techniques, are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional closure models in large eddy simulations (LES). Although a priori investigations –where models are tested on pre-existing datasets – have demonstrated remarkable performance, a posteriori investigations – which assess model behavior within a running simulation – remain crucial to ensuring stability and accuracy. To bridge this gap, seamless integration between computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers and widely used DL frameworks, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow is required. However, traditional CFD solvers are highly optimized for CPU execution, whereas DL inference benefits from acceleration on GPUs or other specialized hardware. This architectural mismatch presents a significant challenge in efficiently leveraging modern heterogeneous HPC platforms.To address this issue, we introduce AIxeleratorService, an open-source C++ library designed to enable efficient deployment of DL models within highly parallel CFD solvers running on heterogeneous architectures. Additionally, we present a Fortran ML module that integrates AIxeleratorService, providing users of Fortran-based CFD solvers with a streamlined, end-to-end workflow for incorporating trained DL architectures into their simulations. We validate our approach by coupling AIxeleratorService with our in-house CFD solver, CIAO, and applying it to two LES configurations. In one, a super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) reconstructs the unresolved Reynolds stresses tensor to correctly account for the momentum energy transport. On the other, a UNet-type architecture computes the source term of the progress variable equation, which is essential for accurately describing the chemical reaction rate and flame propagation in turbulent combustion. To evaluate computational performance and scalability, we benchmark AIxeleratorService against the existing PhyDLL library on a heterogeneous HPC system comprising Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs and NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Our results demonstrate that AIxeleratorService achieves superior computational efficiency and scalability, highlighting its potential for accelerating large-scale, AI-enhanced reactive flow simulations.},

abstract = {Machine Learning models often require a large amount of data in order to be successful. This is troublesome in domains where collecting real-world data is difficult and/or expensive. Data simulators do exist, but they do not sufficiently reflect the real world data due to factors such as a lack of real-world noise. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been modified to refine simulated image data to better fit real world characteristics, using the SimGAN method. While evolutionary computing has been used for GAN evolution, there are currently no frameworks that can evolve a SimGAN. In this paper we (1) extend the SimGAN method to refine one-dimensional data, (2) modify Easy Cartesian Genetic Programming (ezCGP), an evolutionary computing framework, to create SimGANs that more accurately refine simulated data, and (3) create new feature-based quantitative metrics to evaluate refined data. We also use our framework to augment an electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset, a domain that suffers from the issues previously mentioned. In particular, while healthy ECGs can be simulated there are no current simulators of abnormal ECGs. We show that by using an evolved SimGAN to refine simulated healthy ECG data to mimic real-world abnormal ECGs, we can improve the accuracy of ECG classifiers.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) exhibited significant capabilities in many applications including image enhancement and manipulation, language translation, generating images/videos from text, creating art and music, and so on. However, training GANs using large datasets remains highly computationally intensive for most of the standalone systems. Additionally, standalone GANs often exhibit poor synchronization between their generator and discriminator with unstable training, poor convergence along with a large number of mode collapses and vanishing/exploding gradients. Standalone GANs also failed to learn in a decentralized environment, where the data are distributed among several client machines. Some researchers have lately used the most prevalent decentralized setting available today, called Federated Learning (FL) to develop distributed-GAN strategies as the possible solutions, although their implementations mostly failed to address the above issues mainly because of the training instability within the distributed components, which eventually leads to the poor synchronization among the generators and discriminators scattered over several machines.In this work, we developed a computationally inexpensive Wasserstein conditional Distributed Relativistic Discriminator-GAN (DRD-GAN) to alleviate the above issues. DRD-GAN stabilizes its training (with non-convex losses) by keeping a global generator in the central server and relativistic discriminators in the local clients (one discriminator per client) and uses Wasserstein-1 for computing local and global losses. It eventually avoids mode collapses, vanishing/exploding gradients (both in the presence of iid and non-iid samples) and helps DRD-GAN to produce high-quality fake images. Apart from that, the sheer unavailability of a capable conditional distributed-GAN model has become another motivation behind the current work. Essentially, we revisited the FL paradigms, locating one discriminator per client and a generator in the central server that aggregates the updates coming from multiple discriminators. Relativistic discriminators in the clients are trained on both iid and non-iid private data. We presented a detailed mathematical formulation of DRD-GAN and empirically evaluated our claims using CIFAR-10, MNIST, EuroSAT, and CelebA datasets.},

abstract = {Cloud computing and cloud-native platforms have rendered runtime environments more malleable. Simultaneously, the growing demand for flexible and agile software applications and services has driven the emergence of self-adaptive architectures. These architectures, in turn, facilitate software performance modeling, tuning, optimization, and scaling in a continuous manner, blurring the boundary between development-time and run-time. Self-adaptive software employs feedback loop controllers inspired by control theory or variations of the Monitoring-Analysis-Planning-Acting (MAPE) architecture. Whether implemented in a centralized or decentralized manner, most controllers utilize performance models that are learned or tuned at run-time. This shift implies that software is designed to be observable and controllable during execution, presupposing the co-design of software applications and their runtime controllers.This talk commences with a succinct overview of the evolution of self-adaptive software, accentuating key milestones along the journey. Subsequently, recent advancements in software performance modeling at runtime and the role of learning-enabled performance management during software operation are presented.Two recent works are highlighted: one focusing on constructing robust performance models to sustain continuous operation and deployment of cloud-native software, and the other on utilizing multimodal models for performance anomaly detection. The former supports cloud operations like continuous deployment of co-located applications, migration, consolidation of services, or scaling in response to workloads or interferences. The latter is tailored to support performance anomaly detection, localization, and identification of root causes, facilitating swift remediation of faults using generative AI. The final segment of the talk delves into current challenges in developing self-adaptive systems, presenting insights from a recent survey on the state of self-adaptive software in the industry and the challenges perceived by practitioners.},

abstract = {Contemporary concerns over the governance of technological systems often run up against narratives about the technical infeasibility of designing mechanisms for accountability. While in recent AI ethics literature these concerns have been deliberated predominantly in relation to machine learning, other instances in the history of computing also presented circumstances in which computer scientists needed to un-muddle what it means to design accountable systems. One such compelling narrative can frequently be found in canonical histories of the Internet that highlight how its original designers’ commitment to the “End-to-End” architectural principle precluded other features from being implemented, resulting in the fast-growing, generative, but ultimately unaccountable network we have today. This paper offers a critique of such technologically essentialist notions of accountability and the characterization of the “unaccountable Internet” as an unintended consequence. It explores the changing meaning of accounting and its relationship to accountability in a selected corpus of requests for comments (RFCs) concerning the early Internet’s design from the 1970s and 80s. We characterize four ways of conceptualizing accounting: as billing, as measurement, as management, and as policy, and demonstrate how an understanding of accountability was constituted through these shifting meanings. We link together the administrative and technical mechanisms of accounting for shared resources in a distributed system and an emerging notion of accountability as a social, political, and technical category, arguing that the former is constitutive of the latter. Recovering this history is not only important for understanding the processes that shaped the Internet, but also serves as a starting point for unpacking the complicated political choices that are involved in designing accountability mechanisms for other technological systems today.},
