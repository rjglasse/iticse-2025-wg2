abstract = {This paper examines the performance of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in a geographic information systems (GIS) exam. As LLMs like ChatGPT become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including education, it is important to understand their capabilities and limitations in specialized subject areas such as GIS. Human learning of spatial concepts significantly differs from LLM training methodologies. Therefore, this study aims to assess ChatGPT's performance and ability to grasp geospatial concepts by challenging it with a real GIS exam. By analyzing ChatGPT's responses and evaluating its understanding of GIS principles, we gain insights into the potential applications and challenges of LLMs in spatially-oriented fields. We conduct our evaluation with two models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to understand whether general improvements of an LLM translate to improvements in answering questions related to the spatial domain. We find that both GPT variants can pass a balanced, introductory GIS exam, scoring 63.3% (GPT-3.5) and 88.3% (GPT-4), which correspond to grades D and B+ respectively in standard US letter grading scale. In addition, we also identify specific questions and topics where the LLMs struggle to grasp spatial concepts, highlighting the challenges in teaching such topics to these models. Finally, we assess ChatGPT's performance in specific aspects of GIS, including spatial analysis, basic concepts of mapping, and data management. This granular analysis provides further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT's GIS literacy. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the integration of AI models in education and can provide guidance for educators, researchers, and practitioners seeking to leverage LLMs in GIS. By focusing on specific questions or concepts that pose difficulties for the LLM, this study addresses the nuances of teaching spatial concepts to AI models and offers potential avenues for improvement in spatial literacy within future iterations of LLMs.},

abstract = {Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT&nbsp;[8] and GPT-4&nbsp;[9] could enhance programming education in various roles, e.g., by acting as a personalized digital tutor for a student, a digital assistant for an educator, and a digital peer for collaborative learning&nbsp;[1, 2, 7]. In our work, we seek to comprehensively evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art large language models for various scenarios in programming education. Recent works have evaluated several large language models in the context of programming education&nbsp;[4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org &nbsp;[5] (see Figure&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

abstract = {Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life, many opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence. Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a specific area: responding to student programmers’ help requests. More specifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic code that students request help on. Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online programming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and GPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students’ code and assessed the LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently find at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90% of the cases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57% of the time). False positives are common (40% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice that the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better on issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model solutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM responses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than responses to English prompts. Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in programming education. At the same time, the results highlight the unreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do, perhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment systems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future efforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.},

abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to drastically improve the landscape of computing education by automatically generating personalized feedback and content. In particular, this potential lies in the advanced capabilities of state-of-the-art deep generative and large language models such as OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[7], ChatGPT&nbsp;[11], and GPT-4&nbsp;[12]. In our work, we seek to investigate the capabilities of these models in visual programming domains popularly used for K-8 programming education, including domains like Scratch&nbsp;[17], Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5], and Karel&nbsp;[13]. Recent works have shown us sparks of advanced capabilities of such models for various education scenarios in introductory Python programming&nbsp;[2, 14, 18, 20]. In fact, a study in 2022 had ranked Codex in the top quartile w.r.t students in a large Python programming course&nbsp;[8]. However, all these works consider only text-based Python programming and leave open the question of how well these models would perform for visual programming. The main research question is: Do state-of-the-art neural generative models show advanced capabilities for visual programming on par with their capabilities on text-based Python programming?In our work, we evaluate these models for visual programming based on the following three settings designed to capture various generative and problem-solving capabilities: We conduct our evaluation based on 10 representative tasks from two visual programming domains: Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5] and Intro to Programming with Karel course by CodeHS.com&nbsp;[3, 13]. As illustrative examples, Figures&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 show the output of GPT-4 in three settings for Maze18 task. We will provide the detailed analysis and prompts used in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results for ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 show that these models perform poorly and produce incorrect output the majority of the time. These results highlight that state-of-the-art neural generative models like GPT-4 still struggle to combine spatial, logical, and programming skills crucial for visual programming. As the next step, it would be important to curate novel benchmarks that the research community can use to evaluate improvements in future versions of these models for visual programming.},

abstract = {This paper studies recent developments in large language models’ (LLM) abilities to pass assessments in introductory and intermediate Python programming courses at the postsecondary level. The emergence of ChatGPT resulted in heated debates of its potential uses (e.g., exercise generation, code explanation) as well as misuses in programming classes (e.g., cheating). Recent studies show that while the technology performs surprisingly well on diverse sets of assessment instruments employed in typical programming classes the performance is usually not sufficient to pass the courses. The release of GPT-4 largely emphasized notable improvements in the capabilities related to handling assessments originally designed for human test-takers. This study is the necessary analysis in the context of this ongoing transition towards mature generative AI systems. Specifically, we report the performance of GPT-4, comparing it to the previous generations of GPT models, on three Python courses with assessments ranging from simple multiple-choice questions (no code involved) to complex programming projects with code bases distributed into multiple files (599 exercises overall). Additionally, we analyze the assessments that were not handled well by GPT-4 to understand the current limitations of the model, as well as its capabilities to leverage feedback provided by an auto-grader. We found that the GPT models evolved from completely failing the typical programming class’ assessments (the original GPT-3) to confidently passing the courses with no human involvement (GPT-4). While we identified certain limitations in GPT-4’s handling of MCQs and coding exercises, the rate of improvement across the recent generations of GPT models strongly suggests their potential to handle almost any type of assessment widely used in higher education programming courses. These findings could be leveraged by educators and institutions to adapt the design of programming assessments as well as to fuel the necessary discussions into how programming classes should be updated to reflect the recent technological developments. This study provides evidence that programming instructors need to prepare for a world in which there is an easy-to-use widely accessible technology that can be utilized by learners to collect passing scores, with no effort whatsoever, on what today counts as viable programming knowledge and skills assessments.},
