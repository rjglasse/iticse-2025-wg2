abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into software engineering and computer science education, it is crucial to understand their impact on student learning. While recent research has explored student perceptions of generative AI, little is known about how these tools influence students’ cognitive processes during programming tasks, such as code comprehension, a valuable skill in software development and maintenance. This paper presents the design of a study that aims to investigate how computer science students interact with LLMs, such as Google’s Gemini, in the context of code summarization using eye-tracking. This study will examine differences in visual attention, fixation behaviors, and performance of students engaged in code summarization with and without AI assistance across varying experience levels.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly better at a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks (NLP), such as text generation and understanding. Recently, these models have extended their capabilities to coding tasks, bridging the gap between natural languages (NL) and programming languages (PL). Foundational models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and LLaMA series have set strong baseline performances in various NL and PL tasks. Additionally, several models have been fine-tuned specifically for code generation, showing significant improvements in code-related applications. Both foundational and fine-tuned models are increasingly used in education, helping students write, debug, and understand code. We present a comprehensive systematic literature review to examine the impact of LLMs in computer science and computer engineering education. We analyze their effectiveness in enhancing the learning experience, supporting personalized education, and aiding educators in curriculum development. We address five research questions to uncover insights into how LLMs contribute to educational outcomes, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research.},

abstract = {Software testing is a challenging topic in software engineering education and requires creative approaches to engage learners. For example, the Code Defenders game has students compete over a Java class under test by writing effective tests and mutants. While such gamified approaches deal with problems of motivation and engagement, students may nevertheless require help to put testing concepts into practice. The recent widespread diffusion of Generative AI and Large Language Models raises the question of whether and how these disruptive technologies could address this problem, for example, by providing explanations of unclear topics and guidance for writing tests. However, such technologies might also be misused or produce inaccurate answers, which would negatively impact learning. To shed more light on this situation, we conducted the first empirical study investigating how students learn and practice new software testing concepts in the context of the Code Defenders testing game, supported by a smart assistant based on a widely known, commercial Large Language Model. Our study shows that students had unrealistic expectations about the smart assistant, “blindly” trusting any output it generated, and often trying to use it to obtain solutions for testing exercises directly. Consequently, students who resorted to the smart assistant more often were less effective and efficient than those who did not. For instance, they wrote 8.6% fewer tests, and their tests were not useful in 78.0% of the cases. We conclude that giving unrestricted and unguided access to Large Language Models might generally impair learning. Thus, we believe our study helps to raise awareness about the implications of using Generative AI and Large Language Models in Computer Science Education and provides guidance towards developing better and smarter learning tools.},

abstract = {New breakthroughs in code synthesis from Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms are driving significant changes to software engineering education. Having algorithms able to generate components of a software project means that software developers will need stronger skills in requirements specification to guide code generation as well as stronger skills in code review, testing, and integration to incorporate AI-generated code into projects. Shifts in industry and classroom practices are already occurring with the availability of inline code generation tools like GitHub's Copilot, which makes discussion of pedagogical strategies in this area a timely topic. Of immediate concern in computer science education is the potential for LLM-generated code and code help to undermine the learning of CS students. In order to avoid such undermining in even intentional uses of LLM-enhanced learning supports, it is necessary to clarify the roles such supports need to play in the pedagogical process. The Computer Science Matrix Taxonomy provides a strong framework for organizing software testing learning outcomes as well as delineating the operational space in which LLM-based feedback tools should operate to support those learning outcomes. In this paper, the authors operationalize the CS Matrix Taxonomy for software testing learning outcomes and illustrate the integration of LLM-generated test strategy suggestions as an extension of the peer coding/testing model. The work includes examples of AI-generated code testing suggestions that students would use to help guide their own code synthesis for assignments or projects.},

abstract = {The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming Computer Science education, and every instructor is reflecting on how AI will impact their courses. Instructors must determine how students may use AI for course activities and what AI systems they will support and encourage students to use. This task is challenging with the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and related AI systems. The contribution of this work is an experimental evaluation of the performance of multiple open-source and commercial LLMs utilizing retrieval-augmented generation in answering questions for computer science courses and a cost-benefit analysis for instructors when determining what systems to use. A key factor is the time an instructor has to maintain their supported AI systems and the most effective activities for improving their performance.

Software engineering, as an increasingly complex process to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain large-scale software systems for solving real-world challenges, is profoundly affected by many revolutionary artificial intelligence tools in general and machine learning in particular. In this roadmap for artificial intelligence in software engineering, we highlight the recent deep impact of artificial intelligence on software engineering by discussing successful stories of applications of artificial intelligence to classic and new software development challenges. We identify the new challenges that the software engineering community has to address in the coming years to successfully apply artificial intelligence in software engineering, and we share our research roadmap toward the effective use of artificial intelligence in the software engineering profession, while still protecting fundamental human values.We spotlight three main areas that challenge the research in software engineering: the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models for engineering large software systems, the need of large and unbiased datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating deep learning and large language models for software engineering, and the need of a new code of digital ethics to apply artificial intelligence in software engineering.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a leap in artificial intelligence, excelling in tasks using human language(s). Although the main focus of general-purpose LLMs is not code generation, they have shown promising results in the domain. However, the usefulness of LLMs in an academic software engineering project has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we explore the usefulness of LLMs for 214 students working in teams consisting of up to six members. Notably, in the academic course through which this study is conducted, students were encouraged to integrate LLMs into their development tool-chain, in contrast to most other academic courses that explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.In this paper, we analyze the AI-generated code, prompts used for code generation, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base. We also conduct a perception study to gain insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLM from a computer science student's perspective. Our findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures, and helping with syntax and error debugging. These insights provide us with a framework on how to effectively utilize LLMs as a tool to enhance the productivity of software engineering students, and highlight the necessity of shifting the educational focus toward preparing students for successful human-AI collaboration.},

This wave of innovation is reshaping the entire landscape and holds the promise of streamlining the development process, leading to increased productivity and efficiency. By providing text prompts, developers can now receive entirely generated code outputs, representing a fundamental shift in how software is built. This paradigm change can accelerate development cycles and unlock new levels of creativity and ingenuity, resulting in the realization of novel applications and business outcomes. However, this paradigm shift also brings new challenges and necessitates acquiring additional skills for software developers to fully harness the capabilities of LLM-powered tools. These skills include prompt engineering for software development, structural complexity management, debugging of AI errors, and compliance with ethical guidelines and principles.The special session will introduce our NSF-sponsored 3-year project, which aims to integrate LLMs into the standard CS curriculum. To the best of our knowledge, this project is among the first department-level initiatives to renovate CS curriculum, rather than individual courses, with the new developments of LLMs. Our project focuses on (a) enhancing students' problem-solving and programming skills by leveraging LLMs as a learning tool in core programming courses, (b) improving students' software development skills by integrating LLM-powered tools into the software engineering course sequence, and (c) educating students on ethical and responsible AI practices. The special session will discuss the objectives and methods of our project, as well as the current results and lessons learned.This NSF-supported project aims to integrate LLMs into the standard CS curriculum. The revolutionized computer science education will cultivate a new generation of AI-powered responsible developers.

Despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs, there are growing concerns regarding their potential risks in various fields, such as news, education, and software engineering. Recently, several commercial and open source LLM-generated content detectors have been proposed, which, however, are primarily designed for detecting natural language content without considering the specific characteristics of program code. This article aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel ChatGPT-generated code detector, CodeGPTSensor, based on a contrastive learning framework and a semantic encoder built with UniXcoder. To assess the effectiveness of CodeGPTSensor on differentiating ChatGPT-generated code from human-written code, we first curate a large-scale Human and Machine comparison Corpus (HMCorp), which includes 550k pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-generated code (i.e., 288k Python code pairs and 222k Java code pairs). Based on the HMCorp dataset, our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated code reveals the challenge and opportunity of distinguishing ChatGPT-generated code from human-written code with their representative features. Our experimental results indicate that CodeGPTSensor can effectively identify ChatGPT-generated code, outperforming all selected baselines.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in large language model-based generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have transformed computer science education, presenting both opportunities and challenges. A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

Each model was prompted to generate 200 Java and 200 Python quiz questions, totaling 1600 unique questions. These questions are currently being evaluated based on both quantitative and qualitative assessments by a team of computer science educators. Preliminary findings suggest that GPT-4 outperforms BERT in terms of technical precision. Further analysis is ongoing to assess the performance of the models in generating contextually appropriate and educationally useful questions, offering insights into their potential integration into computer science curricula.

abstract = {While many recent studies have explored how large language models can transform computer science instruction from the instructor perspective, they are primarily at the college level. Thus, little is known about using large language models towards curriculum development and teacher supports outside of the college setting. Given the emphasis placed on culturally responsive teaching at the K-8 level and well-documented evidence of insensitive and inaccurate language model outputs from a cultural perspective, it is imperative to perform systematic and principled research before considering their use in this setting.This paper explores the potential of teachers using large language models to brainstorm instructional Scratch projects. Specifically, we use GPT-3 to mimic structured projects from an existing computer science curriculum but situate the generated projects in different contexts/themes. We qualitatively analyze 300 project ideas generated by GPT and find 81% of the generated ideas satisfy our metrics for technical alignment and theme quality. We identify two major weaknesses: code complexity of generated projects and presence of potential insensitive elements that would require human filtering. We conclude that, while not ready as a student-facing solution, teachers could use GPT to effectively brainstorm customized instructional materials.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are already heavily used by professional software engineers. An important skill for new university graduates to possess will be the ability to use such LLMs to effectively navigate and modify a large code base. While much of the prior work related to LLMs in computing education focuses on novice programmers learning to code, less work has focused on how upper-division students use and trust these tools, especially while working with large code bases. In this study, we taught students about various GitHub Copilot features, including Copilot chat, in an upper-division software engineering course and asked students to add a feature to a large code base using Copilot. Our analysis revealed a novel interaction pattern that we call one-shot prompting, in which students ask Copilot to implement the entire feature at once and spend the next few prompts asking Copilot to debug the code or asking Copilot to regenerate its incorrect response. Finally, students reported significantly more trust in the code comprehension features than code generation features of Copilot, perhaps due to the presence of trust affordances in the Copilot chat that are absent in the code generation features. Our study takes the first steps in understanding how upper-division students use Github Copilot so that our instruction can adequately prepare students for a career in software engineering.},

The results showed that ChatGPT independently could solve 19 out of 127 programming tasks generated and assessed by Kattis. Further, ChatGPT was found to be able to generate accurate code solutions for simple problems but encountered difficulties with more complex programming tasks. The results contribute to the ongoing debate on the utility of AI-powered tools in programming education.},

Previous research has evaluated these LLMs for various applications such as generating programming exercises and solutions. However, these evaluations have predominantly been conducted by instructors and researchers, not considering the actual usage of LLMs by students. This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of ChatGPT amongst students. The findings from this investigation have broader implications and may be applicable to other LLMs and their role in computing education.},

Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

abstract = {The emergence of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT poses unprecedented risks of new types of plagiarism and cheating where students use LLMs to solve exercises for them. Detecting this behavior will be a necessary component in introductory computer science (CS1) courses, and educators should be well-equipped with detection tools when the need arises. However, ChatGPT generates code non-deterministically, and thus, traditional similarity detectors might not suffice to detect AI-created code. In this work, we explore the affordances of Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection task. We used an openly available dataset of student programs for CS1 assignments and had ChatGPT generate code for the same assignments, and then evaluated the performance of both traditional machine learning models and Abstract Syntax Tree-based (AST-based) deep learning models in detecting ChatGPT code from student code submissions. Our results suggest that both traditional machine learning models and AST-based deep learning models are effective in identifying ChatGPT-generated code with accuracy above 90%. Since the deployment of such models requires ML knowledge and resources that are not always accessible to instructors, we also explore the patterns detected by deep learning models that indicate possible ChatGPT code signatures, which instructors could possibly use to detect LLM-based cheating manually. We also explore whether explicitly asking ChatGPT to impersonate a novice programmer affects the code produced. We further discuss the potential applications of our proposed models for enhancing introductory computer science instruction.},

We present our preliminary work on developing prompt-engineering strategies to mitigate bias in content generated by LLMs in computer science (CS) education.

We focus on an initial list of prompting strategies for mitigating bias and explore their impact on educational content generation. Recent research has shown the efficacy of prompt-base debiasing [1] as well as the potential disadvantages of using prompts that have not been mitigated for bias, from user dissatisfaction [2] to unsafe outputs [5, 6]. Additionally, a growing body of empirical work points to the idea that certain properties of in-context examples such as flow [7], illustration [3], and order [4] could either improve or derail LLM performance. Our study leverages these findings in the context of generating educational content. The goal is to promote fairness-aware approaches which can be applied to the automated generation of learning materials and the development of LLM-based educational tools. This work also contributes practical insights on prompt-engineering to the evolving curriculum of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI).},

Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

Many believe that they have the potential to perform general-purpose problem-solving in software development and replace human software developers. Nevertheless, there are in a lack of serious investigation into the capability of these LLM techniques in fulfilling software development tasks. In a controlled 2 \texttimes{} 2 between-subject experiment with 109 participants, we examined whether and to what degree working with ChatGPT was helpful in the coding task and typical software development task and how people work with ChatGPT. We found that while ChatGPT performed well in solving simple coding problems, its performance in supporting typical software development tasks was not that good. We also observed the interactions between participants and ChatGPT and found the relations between the interactions and the outcomes. Our study thus provides first-hand insights into using ChatGPT to fulfill software engineering tasks with real-world developers and motivates the need for novel interaction mechanisms that help developers effectively work with large language models to achieve desired outcomes.},

abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Processing and has transformed conversational tasks across various domains because of their widespread integration in applications and public access. The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study, we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure responsible and effective implementation.},

Leveraging large language models (LLMs), CS50.ai offers a suite of AI-based tools that assist both students and instructors in mastering course material while overcoming the limitations posed by human resource constraints. This demo highlights how generative AI can be employed to conduct code reviews and pair-programming simulations, providing real-time feedback, code explanations, and collaborative programming insights. By integrating these AI tools into students' learning journeys, we aim to mimic the 1:1 interaction between instructor and student, improving both formative and summative assessments. We will showcase how these tools are implemented to scale personalized feedback, ensure academic integrity, and maintain pedagogical efficacy. Our presentation will also reflect on lessons learned from deploying these AI-driven tools in recent course offerings.},

abstract = {Novice programmers often face challenges in designing computational artifacts and fixing code errors, which can lead to task abandonment and over-reliance on external support. While research has explored effective meta-cognitive strategies to scaffold novice programmers' learning, it is essential to first understand and assess students' conceptual, procedural, and strategic/conditional programming knowledge at scale. To address this issue, we propose a three-model framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate, classify, and correct student responses to programming questions based on the SOLO Taxonomy. The SOLO Taxonomy provides a structured approach for categorizing student understanding into four levels: Pre-structural, Uni-structural, Multi-structural, and Relational. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieved high accuracy in generating and classifying responses for the Relational category, with moderate accuracy in the Uni-structural and Pre-structural categories, but struggled with the Multi-structural category. The model successfully corrected responses to the Relational level. Although further refinement is needed, these findings suggest that LLMs hold significant potential for supporting computer science education by assessing programming knowledge and guiding students toward deeper cognitive engagement.},

abstract = {In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements, significantly impacting various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and software engineering. These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM application development.Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).},

abstract = {There has been a recent explosion of research on Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering tasks, in particular code generation. However, results from LLMs can be highly unstable; non-deterministically returning very different code for the same prompt. Such non-determinism affects the correctness and consistency of the generated code, undermines developers’ trust in LLMs, and yields low reproducibility in LLM-based papers. Nevertheless, there is no work investigating how serious this non-determinism threat is.To fill this gap, this article conducts an empirical study on the non-determinism of ChatGPT in code generation. We chose to study ChatGPT because it is already highly prevalent in the code generation research literature. We report results from a study of 829 code generation problems across three code generation benchmarks (i.e., CodeContests, APPS and HumanEval) with three aspects of code similarities: semantic similarity, syntactic similarity, and structural similarity. Our results reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high degree of non-determinism under the default setting: the ratio of coding tasks with zero equal test output across different requests is 75.76%, 51.00% and 47.56% for three different code generation datasets (i.e., CodeContests, APPS and HumanEval), respectively. In addition, we find that setting the temperature to 0 does not guarantee determinism in code generation, although it indeed brings less non-determinism than the default configuration (temperature  (=)  1). In order to put LLM-based research on firmer scientific foundations, researchers need to take into account non-determinism in drawing their conclusions.},

abstract = {Courses in computer science (CS) often assess student programming assignments manually, with the intent of providing in-depth feedback to each student regarding correctness, style, efficiency, and other quality attributes. As class sizes increase, however, it is hard to provide detailed feedback consistently, especially when multiple assessors are required to handle a larger number of assignment submissions. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising alternative to help automate this process in a consistent, scalable, and minimally-biased manner.This paper explores ChatGPT-4's scalablility and accuracy in assessing programming assignments based on predefined rubrics in the context of a case study we conducted in an upper-level undergraduate and graduate CS course at Vanderbilt University. In this case study, we employed a method that compared assessments generated by ChatGPT-4 against human graders to measure the accuracy, precision, and recall associated with identifying programming mistakes. Our results show that when ChatGPT-4 is used properly (e.g., with appropriate prompt engineering and feature selection) it can improve objectivity and grading efficiency, thereby acting as a complementary tool to human graders for advanced computer science graduate and undergraduate students.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering has intensified the need for improved model and resource efficiency. In particular, for neural code generation, LLMs are used to translate function/method signature and DocString to executable code. DocStrings, which capture user requirements for the code and are typically used as the prompt for LLMs, often contain redundant information. Recent advancements in prompt compression have shown promising results in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their applicability to code generation remains uncertain. Our empirical study show that the state-of-the-art prompt compression methods achieve only about 10% reduction, as further reductions would cause significant performance degradation. In our study, we propose a novel compression method, ShortenDoc, dedicated to DocString compression for code generation. Our experiments on six code generation datasets, five open-source LLMs (1B to 10B parameters) and one closed-source LLM GPT-4o confirm that ShortenDoc achieves 25–40% compression while preserving the quality of generated code, outperforming other baseline methods at similar compression levels. The benefit of this method is to improve efficiency and reduce the token processing cost while maintaining the quality of the generated code, especially when calling third-party APIs.},

While GenAI certainly poses threats to time-honored instructional techniques, it also provides opportunities for new forms of instructional support. In this work, we introduce our strategy for configuring an LLM to serve as a ''rubber duck debugging'' coding assistant to help novice programmers when they encounter difficulties in programming assignments. The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices. This work contributes an easily replicated and model-agnostic instructional strategy that productively and responsibly leverages the power of LLMs to assist novice programmers in developing foundational programming skills.},

abstract = {The integration of large language models (LLMs) into computing education offers many potential benefits to student learning, and several novel pedagogical approaches have been reported in the literature. However LLMs also present challenges, one of the most commonly cited being that of student over-reliance. This challenge is compounded by the fact that LLMs are always available to provide instant help and solutions to students, which can undermine their ability to independently solve problems and diagnose and resolve errors. Providing instructor oversight of LLM-generated content can mitigate this problem, however it is often not practical in real-time learning contexts. Online class discussion forums, which are widely used in computing education, present an opportunity for exploring instructor oversight because they operate asynchronously. Unlike real-time interactions, the discussion forum format aligns with the expectation that responses may take time, making oversight not only feasible but also pedagogically appropriate. In this practitioner paper, we present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a ‘bot’ module that is controlled by the instructor, and integrated into an online discussion forum. The bot assists the instructor by generating draft responses to student questions, which are reviewed, modified, and approved before release. Key features include the ability to leverage course materials, access archived discussions, and publish responses anonymously to encourage open participation. We report our experiences using this tool in a 12-week second-year software engineering course on object-oriented programming. Instructor feedback confirmed the tool successfully alleviated workload but highlighted a need for improvement in handling complex, context-dependent queries. We report the features that were viewed as most beneficial, and suggest avenues for future exploration.},

However, creating scenarios to explore the software (such as test charters) can be time-consuming, and depending on the team’s experience, it may lack adequate coverage of functionalities and scenarios that target specific user profiles of the application. Objective: This article investigates how AI, through LLMs (Large Language Models), can assist in creating exploratory test charters that reflect the characteristics and needs of different user personas. Method: To achieve this, an experimental study was conducted where personas were used as input in ChatGPT 3.5 to generate exploratory test charters. The effectiveness of the approach was evaluated by Software Engineering students, who analyzed the performance and usefulness of the generated charters through a questionnaire based on the TAM model, supplemented by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results: Data analysis indicated positive acceptance of ChatGPT 3.5 by the participants, highlighting its ease of use and perceived usefulness. Conclusion: This study contributes to the field of Software Engineering by demonstrating a practical application of artificial intelligence in the automated generation of test charters. ChatGPT 3.5 has proven to be a promising tool to support the creation of personalized exploratory test charters, contributing to software quality improvement. The integration of artificial intelligence techniques with user-centered design methods can significantly optimize the software testing process.},

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently discussed in academia and the general public as support tools for virtually any use case that relies on the production of text, including software engineering. Currently, there is much debate, but little empirical evidence, regarding the practical usefulness of LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT for engineers in industry. We conduct an observational study of 24 professional software engineers who have been using ChatGPT over a period of one week in their jobs, and qualitatively analyse their dialogues with the chatbot as well as their overall experience (as captured by an exit survey). We find that rather than expecting ChatGPT to generate ready-to-use software artifacts (e.g., code), practitioners more often use ChatGPT to receive guidance on how to solve their tasks or learn about a topic in more abstract terms. We also propose a theoretical framework for how the (i) purpose of the interaction, (ii) internal factors (e.g., the user's personality), and (iii) external factors (e.g., company policy) together shape the experience (in terms of perceived usefulness and trust). We envision that our framework can be used by future research to further the academic discussion on LLM usage by software engineering practitioners, and to serve as a reference point for the design of future empirical LLM research in this domain.},

Specifically, we first present GPABench2, a benchmarking dataset of over 2.8 million comparative samples of human-written, GPT-written, GPT-completed, and GPT-polished abstracts of scientific writing in computer science, physics, and humanities and social sciences. Second, we explore the methodology for detecting ChatGPT content. We start by examining the unsatisfactory performance of existing ChatGPT detecting tools and the challenges faced by human evaluators (including more than 240 researchers or students). We then test the hand-crafted linguistic features models as a baseline and develop a deep neural framework named CheckGPT to better capture the subtle and deep semantic and linguistic patterns in ChatGPT written literature. Last, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed CheckGPT framework in each benchmarking task over different disciplines. To evaluate the detectability of ChatGPT content, we conduct extensive experiments on the transferability, prompt engineering, and robustness of CheckGPT.},

We discuss how advances in software engineering such as program repair and analysis can enable automatic programming. We conclude with a forward looking view, focusing on the programming environment of the near future, where programmers may need to switch to different roles to fully utilize the power of automatic programming.

abstract = {Empirical software engineering research on production systems has brought forth a better understanding of the software engineering process for practitioners and researchers alike. However, only a small subset of production systems is studied, limiting the impact of this research. While software engineering practitioners could benefit from replicating research on their own data, this poses its own set of challenges, since performing replications requires a deep understanding of research methodologies and subtle nuances in software engineering data. Given that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, show promise in tackling both software engineering- and science-related tasks, these models could help replicate and thus democratize empirical software engineering research.
 

 
In this paper, we examine GPT-4’s abilities to perform replications of empirical software engineering research on new data. We specifically study their ability to surface assumptions made in empirical software engineering research methodologies, as well as their ability to plan and generate code for analysis pipelines on seven empirical software engineering papers. We perform a user study with 14 participants with software engineering research expertise, who evaluate GPT-4-generated assumptions and analysis plans (i.e., a list of module specifications) from the papers. We find that GPT-4 is able to surface correct assumptions, but struggles to generate ones that apply common knowledge about software engineering data. In a manual analysis of the generated code, we find that the GPT-4-generated code contains correct high-level logic, given a subset of the methodology. However, the code contains many small implementation-level errors, reflecting a lack of software engineering knowledge. Our findings have implications for leveraging LLMs for software engineering research as well as practitioner data scientists in software teams.},

abstract = {Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.},

Query languages are illustrated and tested through toy examples: small, accessible, instances of databases. These are not always engaging, but coming up with new examples and questions is time-consuming. Existing research in Computer Science Education has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate coding exercises. However, this has not been demonstrated for SQL yet but could save teachers much time. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to have ChatGPT-3.5 generate database schemas and associated SQL questions for teachers through a two-part study. Through a survey of educators, we found that creating a story and database schema for the SQL part is more time-consuming than the questions themselves. In our prompt engineering study, we identified prompts that were successful at creating database schemas, mock data, and exercises. However, although ChatGPT could help reduce the time required to create exams, some participants indicated that they are skeptical about using LLMs.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities to generate accurate code snippets given natural language intents in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without the need for specific fine-tuning. While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios.},

Overall, GPT-4 provided accurate feedback and successfully built on students' ideas in most submissions. Human evaluators (computer science instructors and tutors) rated GPT-4's hints as useful in guiding students' next steps.

The LLMs are mainly utilized in the prompt-based zero/few-shot paradigm to guide the model in accomplishing the task. GPT-based models are one of the popular ones studied for tasks such as code comment generation or test generation. These tasks are 'generative' tasks. However, there is limited research on the usage of LLMs for 'non-generative' tasks such as classification using the prompt-based paradigm. In this preliminary exploratory study, we investigated the applicability of LLMs for Code Clone Detection (CCD), a non-generative task. By building a mono-lingual and cross-lingual CCD dataset derived from CodeNet, we first investigated two different prompts using ChatGPT to detect Type-4 code clones in Java-Java and Java-Ruby pairs in a zero-shot setting. We then conducted an analysis to understand the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT in CCD. ChatGPT surpasses the baselines in cross-language CCD attaining an F1-score of 0.877 and achieves comparable performance to fully fine-tuned models for mono-lingual CCD, with an F1-score of 0.878. Also, the prompt and the difficulty level of the problems has an impact on the performance of ChatGPT. Finally, we provide insights and future directions based on our initial analysis1.},

We ground the generation of the LLM’s questions based on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) 10-question inventory, a test that help identify whether someone is at risk of alcohol use disorder.},

However, creating and adding subgoal labels to programming assignments is often hard to articulate and very time-intensive for instructors. In Computing Education Research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to generate human-like outputs such as worked examples and source code. In this work, we explore whether ChatGPT could be used to generate high-quality and appropriate subgoal labels in two programming curricula. Our qualitative data analysis suggests that LLMs can assist instructors in creating subgoal labels in their classrooms, opening up directions to empower students' learning experience in programming classrooms.},

In computing education, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these models to improve learning and teaching experiences in university-level programming courses. However, research into leveraging them to aid computer science instructors in curriculum development and course material design is relatively sparse, especially at the K-12 level. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the capability of large language models in ideating and designing culturally responsive projects for elementary and middle school programming classes. Our ultimate goal is to support K-8 teachers in effectively extracting suggestions from large language models by only using natural language modifications. Furthermore, we aim to develop a comprehensive assessment framework for culturally responsive AI-generated project ideas. We also hope to provide valuable insight into teachers’ perspectives on large language models and their integration into teaching practices.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLM) are one of the most important discoveries in machine learning in recent years. LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, such as ChatGPT, have consistently attracted attention from researchers, investors, and the general public, driving the rapid growth of this industry. With dozens of new LLMs released every month, it becomes quite challenging to differentiate between them, thereby creating a demand for new LLM comparison methods.
In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework (ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed. It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product.
To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario.
The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). The outputs of ConSCompF may provide useful insights into data that might have been used during LLM training and help detect potential investment fraud attempts.},

Amongst these, decision-based attacks are particularly insidious due to their nature of requiring only the model's decision output, which makes them notably challenging to counteract. This paper presents L-AutoDA (Large Language Model-based Automated Decision-based Adversarial Attacks), an innovative methodology that harnesses the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to streamline the creation of such attacks. L-AutoDA employs an evolutionary strategy, where iterative interactions with LLMs lead to the autonomous generation of potent attack algorithms, thereby reducing human intervention. The performance of L-AutoDA was evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, where it demonstrated substantial superiority over existing baseline methods in terms of success rate and computational efficiency. Ultimately, our results highlight the formidable utility of language models in crafting adversarial attacks and reveal promising directions for constructing more resilient AI systems.},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts. Integrating LLMs within the SE landscape (LLM4SE) has become a burgeoning trend, necessitating exploring this emergent landscape’s challenges and opportunities.The article aims at revisiting the software development lifecycle (SDLC) under LLMs, and highlighting challenges and opportunities of the new paradigm. The article first summarizes the overall process of LLM4SE, and then elaborates on the current challenges based on a through discussion. The discussion was held among more than 20 participants from academia and industry, specializing in fields such as SE and artificial intelligence. Specifically, we achieve 26 key challenges from seven aspects, including software requirement and design, coding assistance, testing code generation, code review, code maintenance, software vulnerability management, and data, training, and evaluation.

Specifically, in the paper, we share our initial results involving the use of ChatGPT to migrate a client application to use a newer version of SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library widely used in Python. We evaluate the use of three types of prompts (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Chain Of Thoughts) and show that the best results are achieved by the One-Shot prompt, followed by the Chain Of Thoughts. Particularly, with the One-Shot prompt we were able to successfully migrate all columns of our target application and upgrade its code to use new functionalities enabled by SQLAlchemy’s latest version, such as Python’s asyncio and typing modules, while preserving the original code behavior.},

abstract = {In the evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) tailored for software engineering, the need for benchmarks that accurately reflect real-world development scenarios is paramount. Current benchmarks are either too simplistic or fail to capture the multi-tasking nature of software development. To address this, we introduce CoderUJB, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across diverse Java programming tasks that are executable and reflective of actual development scenarios, acknowledging Java's prevalence in real-world software production. CoderUJB comprises 2,239 programming questions derived from 17 real open-source Java projects and spans five practical programming tasks. Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the coding abilities of various open-source and closed-source LLMs, examining the effects of continued pre-training in specific programming languages code and instruction fine-tuning on their performance. The findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit strong potential, challenges remain, particularly in non-functional code generation (e.g., test generation and defect detection). Importantly, our results advise caution in the specific programming languages continued pre-training and instruction fine-tuning, as these techniques could hinder model performance on certain tasks, suggesting the need for more nuanced strategies. CoderUJB thus marks a significant step towards more realistic evaluations of programming capabilities in LLMs, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these models in software engineering.},

Prevailing match-based CEMs (e.g., BLEU, Accuracy, and CodeBLEU) suffer from two significant drawbacks. 1. They primarily measure the surface differences between codes without considering their functional equivalence. However, functional equivalence is pivotal in evaluating the effectiveness of code generation, as different codes can perform identical operations. 2. They are predominantly designed for the Ref-only input format. However, code evaluation necessitates versatility in input formats. Aside from Ref-only, there are NL-only and Ref and NL formats, which existing match-based CEMs cannot effectively accommodate. In this article, we propose CodeScore, a large language model (LLM)-based CEM, which estimates the functional correctness of generated code on three input types. To acquire CodeScore, we present UniCE, a unified code generation learning framework, for LLMs to learn code execution (i.e., learning PassRatio and Executability of generated code) with unified input. Extensive experimental results on multiple code evaluation datasets demonstrate that CodeScore absolutely improves up to 58.87% correlation with functional correctness compared to other CEMs, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and effectively handles three input formats.},

Novice programmers leveraging AI-code-generation without proper understanding of syntax or logic can create "black box" code with significant security vulnerabilities.

abstract = {Scientists use complex multistep workflows to analyze data. However, reproducing computational experiments is often difficult as scientists’ software engineering practices are geared towards the science, not the programming. In particular, reproducing a scientific workflow frequently requires information about its execution. This information includes the precise versions of packages and libraries used, the particular processor used to perform floating point computation, and the language runtime used. This can be extracted from data provenance, the formal record of what happened during an experiment. However, data provenance is inherently graph-structured and often large, which makes interpretation challenging. Rather than exposing data provenance through its graphical representation, we propose a textual one and use a large language model to generate it. We develop techniques for prompting large language models to automatically generate textual summaries of provenance data. We conduct a user study to compare the effectiveness of these summaries to the more common node-link diagram representation. Study participants are able to extract useful information from both the textual summaries and node-link diagrams. The textual summaries were particularly beneficial for scientists with low computational expertise. We discuss the qualitative results from our study to motivate future designs for reproducibility tools.},

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective ➊), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective ➋). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches.We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.},

Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework and present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset for assessing and improving LLM alignment with coding preferences. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are annotated using GPT-3.5 as a judge, with both ranking-based scores and detailed textual feedback across five distinct coding preferences. Our analysis reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are consistently rated higher than those from open-weight models, underscoring substantial alignment gaps between closed- and open-weight LLMs. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned model achieves an average alignment improvement of 22.7% and 29.7% when evaluated with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 judges, respectively. Notably, our aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct surpasses much larger models, such as CodeLlama-13B and 34B, in alignment with coding preferences. Despite not being explicitly trained for functional correctness, it also achieves a 10.5% and 26.6% relative improvement in Pass@ (1)  and Pass@ (10)  on the HumanEval+ benchmark. Our contributions demonstrate the practical value of preference tuning in code generation and set the stage for further progress in model alignment and RLAIF for automated software engineering.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineers' daily practices, it is important to ensure that the code generated by these tools is not only functionally correct but also free of vulnerabilities. Although LLMs can help developers to be more productive, prior empirical studies have shown that LLMs can generate insecure code. There are two contributing factors to the insecure code generation. First, existing datasets used to evaluate LLMs do not adequately represent genuine software engineering tasks sensitive to security. Instead, they are often based on competitive programming challenges or classroom-type coding tasks. In real-world applications, the code produced is integrated into larger codebases, introducing potential security risks. Second, existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on the functional correctness of the generated code while ignoring security considerations. Therefore, in this paper, we described Sallm, a framework to benchmark LLMs' abilities to generate secure code systematically. This framework has three major components: a novel dataset of security-centric Python prompts, configurable assessment techniques to evaluate the generated code, and novel metrics to evaluate the models' performance from the perspective of secure code generation.},

abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence, including the realm of software engineering. In this research, we evaluate the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs in replicating the tasks traditionally performed by developers in response to code review comments. We provide code contexts to five popular LLMs and obtain the suggested code-changes (patch sets) derived from real-world code-review comments. The performance of each model is meticulously assessed by comparing their generated patch sets against the historical data of human-generated patch-sets from the same repositories. This comparative analysis aims to determine the accuracy, relevance, and depth of the LLMs' feedback, thereby evaluating their readiness to support developers in responding to code-review comments. Novelty: This particular research area is still immature requiring a substantial amount of studies yet to be done. No prior research has compared the performance of existing Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-review comments. This in-progress study assesses current LLMs in code review and paves the way for future advancements in automated code quality assurance, reducing context-switching overhead due to interruptions from code change requests.},

abstract = {A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate natural language text, such as GPT, T5, RoBERTa, BERT, etc. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn the patterns and structures of human language. With the increasing amount of multimodal information such as audio, visual, and text data generated, there is a growing need of leveraging large generative language model for multimodal applications. Recently, a few notable multimodal models (e.g., BLIP, Flamingo, KOSMOS, PaLM-E, LLaVA, Visual ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.) with a combination of large language models significantly enhanced their understanding and generate more accurate and nuanced responses. The workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to explore the latest trends and best practices in the field of multimodal applications of large generative models. The workshop will also focus on exploring the challenges and opportunities of integrating large language models with other AI technologies such as computer vision and speech recognition.},

abstract = {The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant debate, highlighting both their potential to augment student learning and the risks associated with their misuse. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, primarily focusing on evaluating the performance of existing models or conducting short-term human subject studies. However, very little work has examined the impacts of LLM-powered assistants on students in entry-level programming courses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To address this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study with 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our research team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the "CodeTutor group" as the experimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their final scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the "control group"). Within the CodeTutor group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered tools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their counterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding CodeTutor's capability to comprehend their queries and assist in learning programming language syntax. However, they had concerns about CodeTutor's limited role in developing critical thinking skills. Over the course of the semester, students' agreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for support from traditional human teaching assistants. Our findings also show that students turned to CodeTutor for different tasks, including programming task completion, syntax comprehension, and debugging, particularly seeking help for programming assignments. Our analysis further reveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with CodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon these results, we discuss the implications of our findings for the need to integrate Generative AI literacy into curricula to foster critical thinking skills, and turn to examining the temporal dynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the discrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual capabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve educational outcomes.},

abstract = {Recently, the rise of code-centric Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped the software engineering world with low-barrier tools like Copilot that can easily generate code. However, there is no correctness guarantee for the code generated by LLMs, which suffer from the hallucination problem, and their output is fraught with risks. Besides, the end-to-end process from specification to code through LLMs is a non-transparent and uncontrolled black box. This opacity makes it difficult for users to understand and trust the generated code. Addressing these challenges is both necessary and critical. In contrast, program refinement transforms high-level specification statements into executable code while preserving correctness. Traditional tools for program refinement are primarily designed for formal methods experts and lack automation and extensibility. We apply program refinement to guide LLM and validate the LLM-generated code while transforming refinement into a more accessible and flexible framework.

(1) Formally refine the specifications,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) Automatically prompt and guide the LLM using refinement calculus,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) Interact with the LLM to generate the code,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4) Verify that the generated code satisfies the constraints, thus guaranteeing its correctness,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(5) Learn and build more advanced refinement laws to extend the refinement calculus.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We evaluated Refine4LLM against the state-of-the-art baselines on program refinement and LLMs benchmarks.The experiment results show that Refine4LLM can efficiently generate more robust code and reduce the time for refinement and verification.},

abstract = {Code generation aims to generate source code implementing human requirements illustrated with natural language specifications. With the rapid development of intelligent software engineering, automated code generation has become a hot research topic in both artificial intelligence and software engineering, and researchers have made significant achievements on code generation. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance on code generation tasks, such as ChatGPT released by OpenAI presents the fantastic potential on automated code generation. However, the existing studies are limited to exploring LLMs' ability for generating code snippets to solve simple programming problems, the task of competition-level code generation has never been investigated. The specifications of the programming competition are always complicated and require the specific input/output format as well as the high-level algorithmic reasoning ability. In this study, we conduct the first large empirical study to investigate the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT for solving competition programming problems. Specifically, we warm up the design of prompts by using the Human-Eval dataset. Then, we apply the well-designed prompt to the competition-level code generation dataset, namely APPS, to further explore the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for solving competition problems. We collect ChatGPT's outputs on 5,000 code competition problems, the evaluation results show that it can successfully pass 25.4% test cases. By further feeding extra information (e.g, test failed information) to ChatGPT, we observe that ChatGPT has the potential to fix partial pass into a fully pass program. Moreover, we investigate the solutions generated by LLMs and the existing solutions, we find that it prefers to directly copy the code instead of re-write when facing more difficult problems. Finally, we evaluate the code quality generated by ChatGPT in terms of "code cleanness", we observe that the generated codes are with small functions and file sizes, which are in line with the standard of clean code.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT. The pace of advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates the use of existing infrastructure to automate the evaluation of LLM performance on computing education tasks. Concept inventories are well suited for evaluation because of their careful design and prior validity evidence. OBJECTIVES. Our research explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework to evaluate computer science (CS) concept inventories. We explore three primary objectives: evaluation of LLM performance on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories; informal expert panel review of items which had variations between LLM and expected student performance; and description of challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation. METHOD. We used the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework to evaluate the SCS1 and BDSI against 10 LLMS with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning: GPT (3.5, 4.0), Claude (1.3, 2.0, 2.1), Llama (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral v0.1 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B. We used psychometric data from prior studies to measure knowledge levels for each LLM run. We then conducted an informal expert review to qualitatively explore how question design, CS content knowledge, and LLM design may explain differences between LLM and expected student performances. FINDINGS. Our quantitative analysis found that most LLM response patterns reflected a below average introductory computing student with the SCS1 and did not fit the psychometric 2PL model for the BDSI. Our qualitative analysis identified that LLMs performed well on code infill questions, but poorly on nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer questions. We also identified several methodological challenges related to item security, translation, the structure when using HELM. IMPLICATIONS. We consider the feasibility of using automated benchmarking as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous investigations to understand the intersection of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. We also consider connections between psychometric approaches and LLM evaluations to inform the design of computing assessments that are more resilient to LLM advancements.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLM) have rapidly affirmed in the latest years as a means to support or substitute human actors in a variety of tasks. LLM agents can generate valid software models, because of their inherent ability in evaluating textual requirements provided to them in the form of prompts. The goal of this work is to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to correctly generate UML class diagrams in activities of Requirements Modeling in the field of Software Engineering. Our aim is to evaluate LLMs in an educational setting, i.e., understanding how valuable are the results of LLMs when compared to results made by human actors, and how valuable can LLM be to generate sample solutions to provide to students. For that purpose, we collected 20 exercises from a diverse set of web sources and compared the models generated by a human and an LLM solver in terms of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic correctness, and distance from a provided reference solution. Our results show that the solutions generated by an LLM solver typically present a significantly higher number of errors in terms of semantic quality and textual difference against the provided reference solution, while no significant difference is found in syntactic and pragmatic quality. We can therefore conclude that, with a limited amount of errors mostly related to the textual content of the solution, UML diagrams generated by LLM agents have the same level of understandability as those generated by humans, and exhibit the same frequency in violating rules of UML Class Diagrams.},

This research assesses existing Java CR models for LLM adjustments, measuring the correlation between their and developers' evaluations of AI-generated Java code. Using the Repertory Grid Technique with 15 developers, we identified 12 key code aspects influencing CR that were consequently assessed by 390 programmers when labeling 120 AI-generated snippets. Our findings indicate that when AI generates concise and executable code, it's often considered readable by CR models and developers.

For a classroom setting, especially, it would be useful to understand whether, and how, to incorporate ChatGPT, similar to any other productivity revolution technology, such as calculators or a Google search engine. Although there are concerns regarding the use of LLMs in business education, the positive or negative impact of LLM use is not well-understood. In this research, we examine the substitution and complementarity effects of using ChatGPT in business curricula on learning outcomes and well-being in a socially supportive learning environment. Specifically, we examine whether technology anchors impact students’ goal orientation, learning outcomes, and well-being by conducting an empirical study with students majoring in Information Systems. Our analysis reveals that a technology anchor (computer playfulness) can complement the effects of social support on learning outcomes, while enhancing well-being for simple tasks. Students’ well-being and learning outcomes are hindered by LLM use (specifically, the computer anxiety anchor), substituting social support for simple and difficult tasks. These findings have implications for educational institutions that are assessing how to incorporate LLMs into business curricula.},

abstract = {In the field of electricity, specialized terminology is often intricate and complex, making it challenging for non-experts to comprehend. However, with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the emergence of large language models provides a new technological solution to address this issue. Large language models, based on deep learning techniques, have the capability to quickly understand and interpret specialized terminology in the electricity domain through learning from a vast corpus of professional literature and data. They can then be applied to various domains, including question-answering systems. However, existing large language models still face issues of unreliable outputs, necessitating a method to evaluate their results and improve the quality of their applications. We propose a knowledge graph-based credibility evaluation method for electric grid large language model knowledge question-answering. This method aligns the answers generated by large language models with the knowledge graph of a local knowledge base and calculates their cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient. We batch-process the answers from the large language model into an electricity dataset and validate them using this method. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can accurately and efficiently reflect the relevance between texts, providing a reliable scoring basis for question-answering by large models in vertical domains. Future research can focus on exploring other embedding methods that can better extract semantic relationships between texts and validating the feasibility of this method in vertical domains other than electricity.},

abstract = {Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to fix bugs by generating patches. And existing work has demonstrated that "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm enables Large Language Models (LLMs) improve fixing capabilities on APR. However, existing work mainly focuses on Full-Model Fine-Tuning (FMFT) for APR and limited research has been conducted on the execution-based evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for APR. Comparing to FMFT, PEFT can reduce computing resource consumption without compromising performance and has been widely adopted to other software engineering tasks.To fill this gap, we enhance the existing APR dataset by employing prompt engineering to create an instruction dataset, APR-Instruction, at first. Secondly, we fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs using four different PEFT methods with APR-Instruction. The best fine-tuned model fixes 58% more bugs than the state-of-the-art LLM-based APR techniques. The results also show that (IA)3 improves the creativity of LLMs more effectively through fine-tuning and achieves the highest fixing capability compared to the other three PEFT methods. Thirdly, we explore the optimal configuration of PEFT hyperparameters, and assess the impact of instruction dataset size, showing that a larger number of parameters and a larger training dataset do not necessarily result in better performance for PEFT. Lastly, we analyze peak memory usage and trainable parameters to show the efficiency of PEFT.This work provides a comprehensive exploration of PEFT on APR and suggests potentially promising directions for extension to other software engineering downstream tasks. APR-Instruction, PEFT weights, and the fine-tuning code are publicly available as open-source resources.},

abstract = {Natural language processing has taken enormous steps during the last few years. The development of large language models and generative AI has elevated natural language processing to the level that it can output coherent and contextually relevant text for a given natural language prompt. ChatGPT is one incarnation of these steps, and its use in education is a rather new phenomenon. In this paper, we study students’ perception on ChatGPT during a computer science course. On the course, we integrated ChatGPT into Teams private discussion groups. In addition, all the students had freedom to employ ChatGPT and related technologies to help them in their coursework. The results show that the majority of students had at least tested AI-powered chatbots, and that students are using AI-powered chatbots for multiple tasks, e.g., debugging code, tutoring, and enhancing comprehension. The amount of positive implications of using ChatGPT takes over the negative implications, when the implications were considered from an understanding, learning and creativity perspective. Relatively many students reported reliability issues with the outputs and that the iterations with prompts might be necessary for satisfactory outputs. It is important to try to steer the usage of ChatGPT so that it complements students’ learning processes, but does not replace it.},

abstract = {Learning to program requires the development of a variety of skills including the ability to read, comprehend, and communicate the purpose of code. In the age of large language models (LLMs), where code can be generated automatically, developing these skills is more important than ever for novice programmers. The ability to write precise natural language descriptions of desired behavior is essential for eliciting code from an LLM, and the code that is generated must be understood in order to evaluate its correctness and suitability. In introductory computer science courses, a common question type used to develop and assess code comprehension skill is the 'Explain in Plain English' (EiPE) question. In these questions, students are shown a segment of code and asked to provide a natural language description of that code's purpose. The adoption of EiPE questions at scale has been hindered by: 1) the difficulty of automatically grading short answer responses and 2) the ability to provide effective and transparent feedback to students. To address these shortcomings, we explore and evaluate a grading approach where a student's EiPE response is used to generate code via an LLM, and that code is evaluated against test cases to determine if the description of the code was accurate. This provides a scalable approach to creating code comprehension questions and enables feedback both through the code generated from a student's description and the results of test cases run on that code. We evaluate students' success in completing these tasks, their use of the feedback provided by the system, and their perceptions of the activity.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, accurately understanding complex driving scenarios has become a critical challenge. Existing computer vision-based solutions exhibit limitations when dealing with dynamic driving environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for understanding autonomous driving scenarios using multimodal large language models. Firstly, we designed a set of questions to guide multimodal large language models in comprehensively understanding driving scenarios, and based on this, we constructed a multimodal driving scenario dataset. This dataset combines open-source nuScenes image data with natural language annotations automatically generated and manually reviewed via the OpenAI API. Subsequently, we conducted visual instruction tuning on the open-source multimodal large language model InternVL-1.5 and proposed the InternDrive model. Furthermore, this paper introduces an evaluation method based on a proprietary large model and conducts a comprehensive assessment of InternDrive's ability to understand driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that InternDrive exhibits superior accuracy in multiple driving scenario understanding tasks. Our research provides new methods and perspectives for enhancing the scene understanding capabilities of autonomous driving systems and showcases the potential application of multimodal large language models in the field of autonomous driving.},

Within this track, there is a binary classification task: discerning comments as either useful or not useful. The dataset includes 9,048 pairs of code comments and surrounding code snippets drawn from open-source C-based projects on GitHub and an additional dataset generated by teams employing large language models. In total, 17 teams representing various universities and software companies have contributed 56 experiments. These experiments were assessed through quantitative metrics, primarily the F1-Score, and qualitative evaluations based on the features developed, the supervised learning models employed, and their respective hyperparameters. It is worth noting that labels generated by large language models introduce bias into the prediction model but lead to less over-fitted results.},

abstract = {In empirical software engineering (EMSE), various activities require human participation, such as data collection, processing, analysis, and comprehension. On one hand, these processes are time-consuming and labor-intensive. On the other hand, human participation may introduce bias. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, the potential for these models to enhance productivity has become apparent. However, the auxiliary capabilities and effectiveness of LLMs in EMSE tasks have rarely been explored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs by using scenarios of human participation in EMSE tasks, i.e., EMSEBench. We conduct replication experiments using four LLMs (ChatGPT4.0, ERNIE Bot4.0, Gemini3.0, and ChatGLM4.0), evaluating the difference in performance across seven scenarios collected from papers published in top SE venues. In the experiments, we perform three types of prompts, i.e., zero-shot, one-shot, and optimized one-shot. Besides, we leverage the concept of multi-agent workflow to explore the performance improvement and limitations of LLMs. Our study summarizes six findings, which facilitate the understanding of the auxiliary of LLMs in EMSE tasks.},

This study explores the implementation of AI-Lab, a framework designed to guide students in the effective and ethical use of generative AI, in this case ChatGPT, in academic settings without compromising skill development. Conducted during Spring 2024, our use of the intervention targeted over 500 Computer Science and Data Science majors enrolled in their major-specific Data Structures and Algorithms courses. The AI-Lab framework enabled students to develop both conceptual questions and c++ and Python programs by interacting with ChatGPT and iteratively correcting its errors. Focus groups and post-intervention surveys revealed a generally positive experience. Students appreciated the ability to leverage AI for tasks outside their major, recognizing the value of understanding correct solutions through AI-assisted programming. Moreover, the guided use of generative AI by professors alleviated concerns regarding academic dishonesty, fostering a supportive learning environment. Despite these benefits, students expressed awareness of the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on AI, noting the risk of impeding their professional growth. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the practical utility of AI for non-major related tasks. This study highlights the importance of incorporating structured AI training in curricula to balance skill development and ethical AI usage, offering insights for broader applications in higher education.},

abstract = {How to best represent words, documents, queries, entities, relations, and other variables in information retrieval (IR) and related applications has been a fundamental research question for decades. Early IR systems relied on the independence assumptions about words and documents for simplicity and scalability, which were clearly sub-optimal from a semantic point of view. The rapid development of deep neural networks in the past decade has revolutionized the representation learning technologies for contextualized word embedding and graph-enhanced document embedding, leading to the new era of dense IR. This talk highlights such impactful shifts in representation learning for IR and related areas, the new challenges coming along and the remedies, including our recent work in large-scale dense IR [1, 9], in graph-based reasoning for knowledge-enhanced predictions [10], in self-refinement of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG)[2,7] and iterative feedback [3,4], in principle-driven self-alignment of LLMs with minimum human supervision [6], etc. More generally, the power of such deep learning goes beyond IR enhancements, e.g., for significantly improving the state-of-the-art solvers for NP-Complete problems in classical computer science [5,8].},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing both natural and programming languages, which have enabled various applications in software engineering, such as requirement engineering, code generation, and software testing. However, existing code generation benchmarks do not necessarily assess the code understanding performance of LLMs, especially for the subtle inconsistencies that may arise between code and its semantics described in natural language.In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Mutation-based Consistency Testing (MCT), to systematically assess the code understanding performance of LLMs, particularly focusing on subtle differences between code and its descriptions, by introducing code mutations to existing code generation datasets. Code mutations are small changes that alter the semantics of the original code, creating a mismatch with the natural language description. MCT uses different types of code mutations, such as operator replacement and statement deletion, to generate inconsistent code-description pairs. MCT then uses these pairs to test the ability of LLMs to detect the inconsistencies correctly.We conduct a case study on the two popular LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, using the state-of-the-art code generation benchmark, HumanEval-X, which consists of 164 programming problems written in six programming languages (Python, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Rust). The results show that the LLMs have significant variations in their code understanding performance and that they have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the mutation type and language. We further explain conditions under which the LLMs result in correct answers using input characteristics (e.g., number of tokens) and investigate to what extent the test results can be improved using one-shot prompts (i.e., providing an additional example). Our MCT method and the case study results provide valuable implications for future research and development of LLM-based software engineering.},

This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks.},

We investigate an opportunity for a positive impact of LLMs on NNES through multilingual programming exercise generation. Following previous work with LLM exercise generation in English, we prompt OpenAI GPT-3.5 in 4 natural languages (English, Tamil, Spanish, and Vietnamese) to create introductory programming problems, sample solutions, and test cases. We evaluate these problems on their sensibility, readability, translation, sample solution accuracy, topicality, and cultural relevance. We find that problems generated in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese are largely sensible, easily understood, and accurate in their sample solutions. However, Tamil problems are mostly non-sensible and have a much lower passing test rate, indicating that the abilities of LLMs for problem generation are not generalizable across languages. Our analysis suggests that these problems could not be given verbatim to students, but with minimal effort, most errors can be fixed. We further discuss the benefits of these problems despite their flaws, and their opportunities to provide personalized and culturally relevant resources for students in their native languages.},

As such, numerous test generation approaches have been proposed and investigated. However, most of these test generation tools produce tests that are typically difficult to understand.

As such, we investigate the usability of tests generated by GitHub Copilot, a proprietary closed-source code generation tool that uses an LLM. We evaluate GitHub Copilot's test generation abilities both within and without an existing test suite, and we study the impact of different code commenting strategies on test generations.Our investigation evaluates the usability of 290 tests generated by GitHub Copilot for 53 sampled tests from open source projects. Our findings highlight that within an existing test suite, approximately 45.28% of the tests generated by Copilot are passing tests; 54.72% of generated tests are failing, broken, or empty tests. Furthermore, if we generate tests using Copilot without an existing test suite in place, we observe that 92.45% of the tests are failing, broken, or empty tests. Additionally, we study how test method comments influence the usability of test generations.},

LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages—for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with n = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students’ time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.},

abstract = {Domain modeling, which represents the concepts and relationships in a problem domain, is an essential part of software engineering. As large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited remarkable ability in language understanding and generation, many approaches are designed to automate domain modeling with LLMs. However, these approaches usually formulate all input information to the LLM in a single step. Our previous single-step approach resulted in many missing modeling elements and advanced patterns. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to enhance fully automated domain model generation. The proposed multi-step automated domain modeling approach extracts model elements (e.g., classes, attributes, and relationships) from problem descriptions. The approach includes instructions and human knowledge in each step and uses an iterative process to identify complex patterns, repeatedly extracting the pattern from various instances and then synthesizing these extractions into a summarized overview. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism. This mechanism assesses each generated model element, offering self-feedback for necessary modifications or removals, and integrates the domain model with the generated self-feedback. The proposed approach is assessed in experiments, comparing it with a baseline single-step approach from our earlier work. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement over our earlier work, with a 22.71% increase in the F1-score for identifying classes, 75.18% for relationships, and a 10.39% improvement for identifying the player-role pattern, with comparable performance for attributes. Our approach, dataset, and evaluation provide valuable insight for future research in automated LLM-based domain modeling.},

abstract = {Most software systems used in production generate system logs that provide a rich source of information about the status and execution behavior of the system. These logs are commonly used to ensure the reliability and maintainability of software systems. The first step toward automated log analysis is generally log parsing, which aims to transform unstructured log messages into structured log templates and extract the corresponding parameters.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown promising results on a wide range of software engineering tasks, including log parsing. However, the extent to which non-determinism influences log parsing using LLMs remains unclear. In particular, it is important to investigate whether LLMs behave consistently when faced with the same log message multiple times.In this study, we investigate the impact of non-determinism in state-of-the-art LLMs while performing log parsing. Specifically, we select six LLMs, including both paid proprietary and free-to-use models, and evaluate their non-determinism on 16 system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects. The results of our study reveal varying degrees of non-determinism among models. Moreover, they show that there is no guarantee for deterministic results even with a temperature of zero.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for the automatic generation of feedback in a wide range of computing contexts. However, concerns have been voiced around the privacy and ethical implications of sending student work to proprietary models. This has sparked considerable interest in the use of open source LLMs in education, but the quality of the feedback that such open models can produce remains understudied. This is a concern as providing flawed or misleading generated feedback could be detrimental to student learning. Inspired by recent work that has utilised very powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the outputs produced by less powerful models, we conduct an automated analysis of the quality of the feedback produced by several open source models using a dataset from an introductory programming course. First, we investigate the viability of employing GPT-4 as an automated evaluator by comparing its evaluations with those of a human expert. We observe that GPT-4 demonstrates a bias toward positively rating feedback while exhibiting moderate agreement with human raters, showcasing its potential as a feedback evaluator. Second, we explore the quality of feedback generated by several leading open-source LLMs by using GPT-4 to evaluate the feedback. We find that some models offer competitive performance with popular proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, indicating opportunities for their responsible use in educational settings.},

abstract = {In the United States, culturally relevant computing (CRC) is one of the most popular pedagogical implementations for Latin American (Latine) students. Culturally-relevant learning resources are a valuable tool for implementing CRC. However, the traditional method of creation and maintenance of textbooks takes a significant amount of time and effort. Given the duration required for textbook production, the development of culturally-relevant learning resources may become lengthened, as it requires close attention both on the material and the incorporation of cultural referents. In order to accelerate the process, we used the advancement of large language models (LLMs) to our advantage. Through prompt engineering, we created a series of prompts to produce a textbook for an introductory computer science course (CS1) that incorporates Latine culture. This textbook was evaluated on metrics regarding sensibility, correctness, readability, linguistic approachability, appropriateness of examples, and cultural relevance. Overall, the generated textbook was mainly sensible, correct, readable, and linguistically approachable. Code examples were not always appropriate due to the usage of libraries that are not typically used in a CS1 course. The cultural relevance was apparent, but it often included surface-level cultural referents. The main incorporation of culture was through geographical locations and people's names. This suggests that the use of LLMs to generate textbooks may serve as a valuable first step for writing culturally-relevant learning resources. Though this study focuses on Latines, our results and prompts may be applicable for generating culturally-relevant CS1 textbooks for other cultures.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to write computer code. This ability can be quite beneficial when integrated into an IDE to assist a programmer with basic coding. On the other hand, it may be misused by computer science students for cheating on coding tests or homework assignments. At present, knowledge about the exact capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs is still inadequate. Furthermore, their capabilities have been changing quickly with each new release. In this paper, we present a dataset of 559 programming exercises in 10 programming languages collected from a system for evaluating coding assignments at our university. We have experimented with four well-known LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Codey, Code Llama) and asked them to solve these assignments. The evaluation results are intriguing and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models. In particular, GPT-4 (which performed the best) is currently capable of solving 55% of all our exercises and achieved an average score of 86% on exercises from the introductory programming course (using the best of five generated solutions).},

Currently, discussions center around potential threats emerging from student's use of ChatGPT. For instance, generative AI will limit the usefulness of graded homework dramatically. However, there exist potential opportunities as well. For example, ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human language allows providing personalized feedback to students, and can thus accompany current software engineering education approaches. This paper highlights the potential for enhancing software engineering education. The availability of generative AI will improve the individualization of education approaches. In addition, we discuss the need to adapt software engineering curricula to the changed profiles of software engineers. Moreover, we point out why it is important to provide guidance for using generative AI and, thus, integrate it in courses rather than accepting the unsupervised use by students, which can negatively impact the students' learning.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) present an exciting opportunity for generating synthetic classroom data. Such data could include code containing a typical distribution of errors, simulated student behavior to address the cold start problem when developing education tools, and synthetic user data when access to authentic data is restricted due to privacy reasons. In this research paper, we conduct a comparative study examining the distribution of bugs generated by LLMs in contrast to those produced by computing students. Leveraging data from two previous large-scale analyses of student-generated bugs, we investigate whether LLMs can be coaxed to exhibit bug patterns that are similar to authentic student bugs when prompted to inject errors into code. The results suggest that unguided, LLMs do not generate plausible error distributions, and many of the generated errors are unlikely to be generated by real students. However, with guidance including descriptions of common errors and typical frequencies, LLMs can be shepherded to generate realistic distributions of errors in synthetic code.},

This work in progress considers the application of large language models for content generation tailored to mastery learning.

abstract = {There is a great need for data in computing education research. Data is needed to understand how students behave, to train models of student behavior to optimally support students, and to develop and validate new assessment tools and learning analytics techniques. However, relatively few computing education datasets are shared openly, often due to privacy regulations and issues in making sure the data is anonymous. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to create large-scale, privacy-preserving synthetic data, which can be used to explore various aspects of student learning, develop and test educational technologies, and support research in areas where collecting real student data may be challenging or impractical. This work explores generating synthetic buggy code submissions for introductory programming exercises using GPT-4o. We compare the distribution of test case failures between synthetic and real student data from two courses to analyze the accuracy of the synthetic data in mimicking real student data. Our findings suggest that LLMs can be used to generate synthetic incorrect submissions that are not significantly different from real student data with regard to test case failure distributions. Our research contributes to the development of reliable synthetic datasets for computing education research and teaching, potentially accelerating progress in the field while preserving student privacy.},

abstract = {Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have gained significant attention in the industry due to their wide applications in the full lifecycle of software engineering.

This paper introduces CodeFuse-13B, an open-sourced pre-trained code LLM 2. It is specifically designed for code-related tasks with both English and Chinese prompts and supports over 40 programming languages. CodeFuse achieves its effectiveness by utilizing a high-quality pre-training dataset that is carefully filtered by program analyzers and optimized during the training process. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world usage scenarios, the industry-standard benchmark HumanEval-x, and the specially designed CodefuseEval for Chinese prompts. To assess the effectiveness of CodeFuse, we actively collected valuable human feedback from the AntGroup's software development process where CodeFuse has been successfully deployed. The results demonstrate that CodeFuse-13B achieves a HumanEval pass@1 score of 37.10%, positioning it as one of the top multi-lingual code LLMs with similar parameter sizes. In practical scenarios, such as code generation, code translation, code comments, and testcase generation, CodeFuse performs better than other models when confronted with Chinese prompts.},

We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be well-aligned with the LOs.

abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot, is transforming educational methodologies, including undergraduate physics courses for engineering students. Despite their potential, these LLMs typically rely on statistical learning methods and often exhibit algebraic inaccuracies in solving standard university-level physics problems. This study explores the use of LLMs in physics courses for N = 91 freshman engineering students over two academic terms (Spring and Fall 2023). Students engaged in AI-assisted activities to solve physics problems and were asked to identify and correct the errors made by the chatbot. The outcomes were compared with those from traditional teaching methods without AI involvement, and no significant difference in student learning gains was found. To assess the impact of AI tools in education, a more detailed approach using pre-test and post-test instruments&nbsp;with control and experimental groups is necessary. Survey results revealed, however, that AI-assisted sessions enhanced student engagement, problem-solving skills, and understanding of physics concepts. Students also indicated a strong preference for AI-assisted activities, citing increased motivation and a firm belief in the educational benefits of using these tools. Our findings suggest that well-designed AI interventions can effectively complement traditional instructional methods, especially when the LLMs are integrated with symbolic computational tools like WolframAlpha to improve their accuracy.},

abstract = {Commit messages concisely describe code changes in natural language and are important for software maintenance. Various automatic commit message generation approaches have been proposed, such as retrieval-based, learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Recently, large language models have shown impressive performance in many natural language processing tasks. Among them, ChatGPT is the most popular one and has attracted wide attention from the software engineering community. ChatGPT demonstrates the ability of in-context learning (ICL), which allows ChatGPT to perform downstream tasks by learning from just a few demonstrations without explicit model tuning. However, it remains unclear how well ChatGPT performs in the commit message generation task via ICL. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT with ICL on commit message generation. Specifically, we first explore the impact of two key settings on the performance of ICL on commit message generation. Then, based on the best settings, we compare ChatGPT with several state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that a carefully-designed demonstration can lead to substantial improvements for ChatGPT on commit message generation. Furthermore, ChatGPT outperforms all the retrieval-based and learning-based approaches in terms of BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and Cider, and is comparable to hybrid approaches. Based on our findings, we outline several open challenges and opportunities for ChatGPT-based commit message generation.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s, a key debate in human-centered computing involving machine learning at IUI is between agent-driven systems and direct manipulation. The explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly auto-regressive as agents serving as chatbots, generative search, and work automation tools, has also brought with it inherent limitations. We posit that efforts to address and alleviate these LLM challenges—hallucinations, unpredictable outputs, lack of transparency, and difficulties in customization—cannot be solved through algorithmic improvements alone but require elevated mixed-initiative interface design at the heart of the IUI community. This workshop aims to bridge the gap between agent-driven automation and direct manipulation by exploring mixed-initiative interaction models that blend the strengths of both paradigms to empower end-users seeking to harness LLMs.},

abstract = {Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized learning in computing education is promising, yet cloud-based LLMs pose risks around data security and privacy. To address these concerns, we developed and deployed a locally stored Small Language Model (SLM) utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. Previous work has demonstrated that SLMs can match or surpass popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) in handling conversational data from a CS1 course. We deployed SLMs with RAG (SLM + RAG) in a large course with more than 250 active students, fielding nearly 2,000 student questions, while evaluating data privacy, scalability, and feasibility of local deployments. This paper provides a comprehensive guide for deploying SLM + RAG systems, detailing model selection, vector database choice, embedding methods, and pipeline frameworks. We share practical insights from our deployment, including scalability concerns, accuracy versus context length trade-offs, guardrails and hallucination reduction, as well as data privacy maintenance. We address the "Impossible Triangle" in RAG systems, which states that achieving high accuracy, short context length, and low time consumption simultaneously is not feasible. Furthermore, our novel RAG framework, Intelligence Concentration (IC), categorizes information into multiple layers of abstraction within Milvus collections mitigating trade-offs and enabling educational assistants to deliver more relevant and personalized responses to students quickly.},

abstract = {This study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) by undergraduate and graduate students for programming assignments in advanced computing classes. Unlike existing research, which primarily focuses on introductory classes and lacks in-depth analysis of actual student-LLM interactions, our work fills this gap. We conducted a comprehensive analysis involving 411 students from a Distributed Systems class at an Indian university, where they completed three programming assignments and shared their experiences through Google Form surveys and interviews.Our findings reveal that students leveraged LLMs for a variety of tasks, including code generation, debugging, conceptual inquiries, and test case creation. They employed a spectrum of prompting strategies, ranging from basic contextual prompts to advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative refinement. While students generally viewed LLMs as beneficial for enhancing productivity and learning, we noted a concerning trend of over-reliance, with many students submitting entire assignment descriptions to obtain complete solutions. Given the increasing use of LLMs in the software industry, our study highlights the need to update undergraduate curricula to include training on effective prompting strategies and to raise awareness about the benefits and potential drawbacks of LLM usage in academic settings.},

Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER, however, has focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments and judging the quality of programming feedback, contrasting the results with proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to introductory Python programming exercises suggest that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs are nearly on par with proprietary models in both generating and assessing programming feedback. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in these tasks and highlight the wide range of LLMs accessible, even for free, to educators and practitioners.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically generative AI (GenAI) are threatening to fundamentally reshape computing and society. Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving.There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms.},

abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is transforming various health-related domains, including approaches to obesity management. Obesity remains one of the world’s leading health issues, prompting the research community to develop various weight-loss applications focused on physical activity, dietary planning, and related interventions. In this study, we explore the capability of the LLM ChatGPT for personalized dietary planning. We conducted two case studies: Case Study 1 examined self-supervised recipe generation using ChatGPT alone, while Case Study 2 investigated a self-supervised approach combining National Institute of Health standards with ChatGPT recipe recommendations. We also performed a user study to evaluate recipe recommendations from ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT recommends appropriate recipes based on comparisons with the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) recipe calculator. We found no significant difference between ChatGPT-generated recipe recommendation calories and USDA standards for either Case Study 1 (p = 0.8530) or Case Study 2 (p = 0.0687). In addition, we found significant weight loss in participants following these recipes in both Case Study 1 (p &lt; 0.00001) and Case Study 2 (p = 0.0014). Furthermore, the user study with potential weight-loss participants revealed varying levels of satisfaction (p = 0.001) and identified themes related to meal preferences, effective prompt generation, and mixed concerns regarding privacy, trust, user consent, and data storage. We conclude by discussing additional findings from our case and user studies, and present opportunities, challenges, and design and ethical considerations for the research community.},

abstract = {Programming skills are typically developed through completing various hands-on exercises. Such programming problems can be contextualized to students’ interests and cultural backgrounds. Prior research in educational psychology has demonstrated that context personalization of exercises stimulates learners’ situational interests and positively affects their engagement. However, creating a varied and comprehensive set of programming exercises for students to practice on is a time-consuming and laborious task for computer science educators. Previous studies have shown that large language models can generate conceptually and contextually relevant programming exercises. Thus, they offer a possibility to automatically produce personalized programming problems to fit students’ interests and needs. This article reports on a user study conducted in an elective introductory programming course that included contextually personalized programming exercises created with GPT-4. The quality of the exercises was evaluated by both the students and the authors. Additionally, this work investigated student attitudes towards the created exercises and their engagement with the system. The results demonstrate that the quality of exercises generated with GPT-4 was generally high. What is more, the course participants found them engaging and useful. This suggests that AI-generated programming problems can be a worthwhile addition to introductory programming courses, as they provide students with a practically unlimited pool of practice material tailored to their personal interests and educational needs.},

abstract = {Code translation between programming languages is a long-existing and critical task in software engineering, facilitating the modernization of legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and enhancing software performance. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and their applications to code translation, there is an increasing need for comprehensive evaluation of these models. In this study, we empirically analyze the generated outputs of eleven popular instruct-tuned LLMs with parameters ranging from 1B up to 46.7B on 3,820 translation pairs across five languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our analysis found that between 26.4% and 73.7% of code translations produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing, as these translations often include a mix of code, quotes, and text rather than being purely source code. Overlooking the output format of these models can inadvertently lead to underestimation of their actual performance. This is particularly evident when evaluating them with execution-based metrics such as Computational Accuracy (CA). Our results demonstrate that a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expression can effectively extract the source code from the model generation output. In particular, our method can help eleven selected models achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our findings shed light on and motivate future research to conduct more reliable benchmarks of LLMs for code translation.},

As LLM-based offerings become mainstream, we explore the incorporation of such LLMs into introductory or undergraduate database systems education. Students and instructors are both faced with the calculator dilemma: while the use of LLM-based tools may “solve” tasks such as assignments and exams, do they impede or accelerate the learning itself? We review deficiencies of using existing off-the-shelf tools for learning, and further articulate the differentiated needs of database systems students as opposed to trained data practitioners. Building on our exploration, we outline a vision that integrates LLMs into database education in a principled manner, keeping pedagogical best practices in mind. If implemented correctly, we posit that LLMs can drastically amplify the impact of existing instruction, minimizing costs and barriers towards learning database systems fundamentals.},

Two critical questions remain: 1) How to optimize LLMs to mimic human expert writing, and 2) Do LLM-generated messages meet clinical standards? We systematically examined the message generation and evaluation processes through three studies investigating prompt engineering (Study 1), decoding optimization (Study 2), and expert review (Study 3). We employed computational linguistic analysis in LLM assessment and established a comprehensive evaluation framework, incorporating automated metrics, linguistic attributes, and expert evaluations. Certified tobacco treatment specialists assessed the quality, accuracy, credibility, and persuasiveness of LLM-generated messages, using expert-written messages as the benchmark. Results indicate that larger LLMs, including ChatGPT, OPT-13B, and OPT-30B, can effectively emulate expert writing to generate well-written, accurate, and persuasive messages, thereby demonstrating the capability of LLMs in augmenting clinical practices of smoking cessation interventions.},

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) started a serious discussion among educators on how LLMs would affect, e.g., curricula, assessments, and students' competencies. Generative AI and LLMs also raised ethical questions and concerns for computing educators and professionals.This experience report presents an assignment within a course on professional competencies, including some related to ethics, that computing master's students need in their careers. For the assignment, student groups discussed the ethical process by Lennerfors et al. by analyzing a case: a fictional researcher considers whether to attend the real CHI 2024 conference in Hawaii. The tasks were (1) to participate in in-class discussions on the case, (2) to use an LLM of their choice as a discussion partner for said case, and (3) to document both discussions, reflecting on their use of the LLM.Students reported positive experiences with the LLM as a way to increase their knowledge and understanding, although some identified limitations. The LLM provided a wider set of options for action in the studied case, including unfeasible ones. The LLM would not select a course of action, so students had to choose themselves, which they saw as coherent.From the educators' perspective, there is a need for more instruction for students using LLMs: some students did not perceive the tools as such but rather as an authoritative knowledge base. Therefore, this work has implications for educators considering the use of LLMs as discussion partners or tools to practice critical thinking, especially in computing ethics education.},

Although being very helpful for comparing different LLMs, existing evaluation focuses on a simple code generation scenario (i.e., function-level or statement-level code generation), which mainly asks LLMs to generate one single code unit (e.g., a function or a statement) for the given natural language description. Such evaluation focuses on generating independent and often small-scale code units, thus leaving it unclear how LLMs perform in real-world software development scenarios.To fill this knowledge gap, we make the first attempt to evaluate LLMs in a more challenging code generation scenario, i.e., class-level code generation. Compared with existing code generation benchmarks, it better reflects real-world software development scenarios due to it comprising broader contextual dependencies and multiple, interdependent units of code. We first manually construct the first class-level code generation benchmark ClassEval of 100 class-level Python code generation tasks with approximately 500 person-hours. Based on the new benchmark ClassEval, we then perform the first study of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on class-level code generation. Based on our results, we find that all LLMs perform much worse on class-level code generation compared to the method-level. While GPT models still dominate other LLMs on class-level code generation, the performance rankings of other models on method-level code generation no longer holds for class-level code generation. Besides, most models (except GPT models) perform better when generating the class method by method; and they have the limited ability of generating dependent code. Based on our findings, we call for software engineering (SE) researchers' expertise to build more LLM benchmarks based on practical and complicated software development scenarios.},

abstract = {Grasping complex computing concepts often poses a challenge for students who struggle to anchor these new ideas to familiar experiences and understandings. To help with this, a good analogy can bridge the gap between unfamiliar concepts and familiar ones, providing an engaging way to aid understanding. However, creating effective educational analogies is difficult even for experienced instructors. We investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, can provide access to personally relevant analogies on demand. Focusing on recursion, a challenging threshold concept, we conducted an investigation analyzing the analogies generated by more than 350 first-year computing students. They were provided with a code snippet and tasked to generate their own recursion-based analogies using ChatGPT, optionally including personally relevant topics in their prompts. We observed a great deal of diversity in the analogies produced with student-prescribed topics, in contrast to the otherwise generic analogies, highlighting the value of student creativity when working with LLMs. Not only did students enjoy the activity and report an improved understanding of recursion, but they described more easily remembering analogies that were personally and culturally relevant.},

abstract = {The development of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini has led to impressive advancements in question answering (QA) systems. However, they often rely on generic knowledge from the internet, resulting in hallucinated answers when applied to domain-specific QA tasks. Furthermore, their operational dependence on powerful GPUs poses challenges for practical software deployment. Building a QA systems for low-resource languages like Vietnamese is even more challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and limited pre-trained language models. In this study, we aim to construct a Vietnamese legal QA system using a retrieval-augmented generation approach to reduce incorrect outputs. Our focus is on improving answer generation accuracy by training small-scale LLMs suitable for real-world deployment. Our contributions are: (i) constructing Vietnamese legal provisions and QA datasets for training the system; and (ii) proposing methods to fine-tune language models with QA capabilities in the legal domain. Experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to train an LLM with fewer computational resources and a smaller dataset while maintaining effectiveness. Our findings highlight that designing an efficient training and fine-tuning strategy is crucial for overcoming these challenges, particularly in the context of Vietnamese legal question-answering tasks.},

In a prior study, we mined 54, 070 Jupyter notebooks from Github and created a catalogue of 269 semantically related visualisation-assertion (VA) pairs. Building on this catalogue, we propose to build a taxonomy that organises the VA pairs based on ML verification tasks. The input feature space comprises of a rich source of information mined from the Jupyter notebooks---visualisations, Python source code, and associated markdown text. The effectiveness of various AI models, including traditional NLP4Code models and modern Large Language Models, will be compared using established machine translation metrics and evaluated through a qualitative study with human participants. The paper also plans to address the challenge of extending the existing VA pair dataset with additional pairs from Kaggle and to compare the tool's effectiveness with commercial generative AI models like ChatGPT.

We use ParEval to evaluate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art open- and closed-source language models on these tasks. We introduce novel metrics for evaluating the performance of generated code, and use them to explore how well each large language model performs for 12 different computational problem types and six different parallel programming models.},

abstract = {Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs. By training a black box machine learning model and “explaining” its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks. However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes. In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models. By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code. We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects. Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans. Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT’s explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%). Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.},

abstract = {The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML, given natural language prompt.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user edited suggestions, as well as user sentiments analysis. The evaluation is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users of code assistants for domain-specific languages. We are also the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures, which is 13.66% on Day 30. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate, called Strong Acceptance rate, where a suggestion is considered accepted only if less than 50% of it is edited and these edits do not change critical parts of the suggestion. By focusing on Ansible, Lightspeed is able to achieve a strong acceptance rate of 49.08% for multi-line Ansible task suggestions. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context. We hope this work serves as a reference for software engineering and machine learning researchers exploring code completion.},

abstract = {Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT&nbsp;[8] and GPT-4&nbsp;[9] could enhance programming education in various roles, e.g., by acting as a personalized digital tutor for a student, a digital assistant for an educator, and a digital peer for collaborative learning&nbsp;[1, 2, 7]. In our work, we seek to comprehensively evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art large language models for various scenarios in programming education. Recent works have evaluated several large language models in the context of programming education&nbsp;[4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org &nbsp;[5] (see Figure&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

Inspired by the dialogic model of abstract metaphors, as well as the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce on-demand support, we investigate the use of metaphors to facilitate engagement between Science and Technology Studies (STS) and System HCI. Our reflective-style survey with early-career HCI researchers (N=48) reported that limited prior exposure to STS research can hinder perceived openness of the work, and ultimately interest in reading. The survey also revealed that metaphors enhance likelihood to continue reading STS papers, and alternative perspectives can build critical thinking skills to mitigate potential risks of LLM-generated metaphors. We lastly offer a specified model of metaphor exchange (within this generative context) that incorporates alternative perspectives to construct shared understanding in interdisciplinary engagement.},

abstract = {Learning effective representations of source code is critical for any Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) system. Inspired by natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) like Codex and CodeGen treat code as generic sequences of text and are trained on huge corpora of code data, achieving state of the art performance on several software engineering (SE) tasks. However, valid source code, unlike natural language, follows a strict structure and pattern governed by the underlying grammar of the programming language. Current LLMs do not exploit this property of the source code as they treat code like a sequence of tokens and overlook key structural and semantic properties of code that can be extracted from code-views like the Control Flow Graph (CFG), Data Flow Graph (DFG), Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), etc. Unfortunately, the process of generating and integrating code-views for every programming language is cumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this barrier, we propose our tool COMEX - a framework that allows researchers and developers to create and combine multiple code-views which can be used by machine learning (ML) models for various SE tasks. Some salient features of our tool are: (i) it works directly on source code (which need not be compilable), (ii) it currently supports Java and C#, (iii) it can analyze both method-level snippets and program-level snippets by using both intra-procedural and inter-procedural analysis, and (iv) it is easily extendable to other languages as it is built on tree-sitter - a widely used incremental parser that supports over 40 languages. We believe this easy-to-use code-view generation and customization tool will give impetus to research in source code representation learning methods and ML4SE. The source code and demonstration of our tool can be found at https://github.com/IBM/tree-sitter-codeviews and https://youtu.be/GER6U87FVbU, respectively.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have become instrumental in advancing software engineering (SE) tasks, showcasing their efficacy in code understanding and beyond. AI code models have demonstrated their value not only in code generation but also in defect detection, enhancing security measures and improving overall software quality. They are emerging as crucial tools for both software development and maintaining software quality. Like traditional SE tools, open source collaboration is key in realizing the excellent products. However, with AI models, the essential need is in data. The collaboration of these AI-based SE models hinges on maximizing the sources of high-quality data. However, data, especially of high quality, often hold commercial or sensitive value, making them less accessible for open source AI-based SE projects. This reality presents a significant barrier to the development and enhancement of AI-based SE tools within the SE community. Therefore, researchers need to find solutions for enabling open source AI-based SE models to tap into resources by different organizations. Addressing this challenge, our position article investigates one solution to facilitate access to diverse organizational resources for open source AI models, ensuring that privacy and commercial sensitivities are respected. We introduce a governance framework centered on federated learning (FL), designed to foster the joint development and maintenance of open source AI code models while safeguarding data privacy and security. Additionally, we present guidelines for developers on AI-based SE tool collaboration, covering data requirements, model architecture, updating strategies, and version control. Given the significant influence of data characteristics on FL, our research examines the effect of code data heterogeneity on FL performance. We consider six different scenarios of data distributions and include four code models. We also include four most common FL algorithms. Our experimental findings highlight the potential for employing FL in the collaborative development and maintenance of AI-based SE models. We also discuss the key issues to be addressed in the co-construction process and future research directions.},

abstract = {Software failures inform engineering work, standards, regulations. For example, the Log4J vulnerability brought government and industry attention to evaluating and securing software supply chains. Retrospective failure analysis is thus a valuable line of software engineering research. Accessing private engineering records is difficult, so such analyses tend to use information reported by the news media. However, prior works in this direction have relied on manual analysis. That has limited the scale of their analyses. The community lacks automated support to enable such analyses to consider a wide range of news sources and incidents.To fill this gap, we propose the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) system. FAIL is a novel LLM-based pipeline that collects, analyzes, and summarizes software failures as reported in the news. FAIL groups articles that describe the same incidents. It then analyzes incidents using existing taxonomies for postmortems, faults, and system characteristics. To tune and evaluate FAIL, we followed the methods of prior works by manually analyzing 31 software failures. FAIL achieved an F1 score of 90% for collecting news about software failures, a V-measure of 0.98 for merging articles reporting on the same incident, and extracted 90% of the facts about failures. We then applied FAIL to a total of 137,427 news articles from 11 providers published between 2010 and 2022. FAIL identified and analyzed 2,457 distinct failures reported across 4,184 articles. Our findings include: (1) current generation of large language models are capable of identifying news articles that describe failures, and analyzing them according to structured taxonomies; (2) high recurrences of similar failures within organizations and across organizations; and (3) severity of the consequences of software failures have increased over the past decade. The full FAIL database is available so that researchers, engineers, and policymakers can learn from a diversity of software failures.},

abstract = {Large language models(LLMS) have shown excellent text generation capabilities, capable of generating fluent human-like responses for many downstream tasks. However, applying large language models to real-world critical tasks remains challenging due to their susceptibility to hallucinations and inability to directly use external knowledge. To cope with the above challenges, this paper proposes PatternGPT, a pattern-driven text generation framework for Large Language Models. Firstly, the framework utilizes the extraction capability of Large Language Models to generate rich and diversified structured and formalized patterns, which facilitates the introduction of external knowledge to do the computation, and then draws on the idea of federated learning to use multiple agents to achieve the sharing in order to obtain more diversified patterns, and finally uses judgment criteria and optimization algorithm to search for high-quality patterns to guide the generation of models. Finally, external knowledge such as judgment criteria and optimization algorithms are used to search for high-quality patterns, and the searched patterns are used to guide model generation. This framework has the advantages of generating diversified patterns, protecting data privacy, combining external knowledge, and improving the quality of generation, which provides an effective method to optimize the text generation capability of large language models, and make it better applied to the field of intelligent dialogue and content generation.},

abstract = {Education-level or socioeconomic background of patients may dictate their ability to understand medical jargon. Inability to understand primary findings from a radiology report may lead to unnecessary anxiety among patients or missed follow up. We aim to meet this challenge by developing a patient-sensitive summarization model for radiology reports. We selected computed tomography (CT) exams of chest as a use-case and collected 7,000 studies from Mayo Clinic. Summarization model was built on top of the T5 large language model (LLM) as our experiments indicated that its text-to-text transfer architecture was suited for abstractive text summarization, resulting in a model with 0.77B trainable parameters. Noisy ground truth for model training was collected by prompting LLaMA-13B model. We recruited experts (board-certified radiologists) and laymen to manually evaluate model-generated summaries generated by model. Our model rarely missed information as marked by majority opinion of radiologists. Laymen indicated 63% improvement in their understanding by reading model-generated layman summaries. Comparison with zero-shot performance of ChatGPT indicated that the proposed model reduced the rate of hallucination by half and rate of missing important information by fivefold. The proposed model can generate reliable summaries for radiology reports understandable by patients with vastly different levels of medical knowledge.},

In accordance with the reasoning logic of the large language model, three prompt templates are designed and the reasons are explored. Experiments show that when the parameters remain unchanged, the data enhanced by this method has been greatly improved under the three prompt templates, alleviating the difficulty of low resources of geological disaster data. And by comparing the performance of different instructions under different learning rates, the fine-tuning learning rate range suitable for the field of geological disasters is summarized. The limitation is that it is constrained by local computing resources, which reduces the parameter scale of LLM, and the recognition performance is low for extremely long or complex texts.},

abstract = {Large Language models (LLMs) can be induced to solve non-trivial problems with "few-shot" prompts including illustrative problem-solution examples. Now if the few-shots also include "chain of thought" (CoT) explanations, which are of the form problem-explanation-solution, LLMs will generate a "explained" solution, and perform even better. Recently an exciting, substantially better technique, self-consistency [1] (S-C) has emerged, based on the intuition that there are many plausible explanations for the right solution; when the LLM is sampled repeatedly to generate a pool of explanation-solution pairs, for a given problem, the most frequently occurring solutions in the pool (ignoring the explanations) tend to be even more likely to be correct!Unfortunately, the use of this highly-performant S-C (or even CoT) approach in software engineering settings is hampered by the lack of explanations; most software datasets lack explanations. In this paper, we describe an application of the S-C approach to program repair, using the commit log on the fix as the explanation, only in the illustrative few-shots. We achieve state-of-the art results, beating previous approaches to prompting-based program repair, on the MODIT dataset; we also find evidence suggesting that the correct commit messages are helping the LLM learn to produce better patches.},

abstract = {As robots become increasingly integrated into human life, personalizing human-robot interactions (HRI) is crucial for improving user acceptance, engagement, and interaction quality. However, personalizing HRI poses a unique challenge due to the diversity of human personality traits. This paper proposes a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically tailor robot conversations according to the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits. Our novelty lies in using user personality traits to shape robots' verbal responses and implementing contextual action generation for gestures. This study addresses two primary research questions: (1) Does adapting robots' verbal responses based on user personality traits improve communication satisfaction? (2) How does the addition of context-appropriate gestures further enhance user satisfaction? We used Goldberg's personality trait measurement scale (1992) to assess 26 participants who engaged in conversations with an LLM-powered Pepper robot on various topics. The quality of these interactions was self-reported using a revised version of Hecht's (1978) conversation satisfaction scale. Three experimental conditions were conducted: (i) Baseline: Standard LLM conversation, (ii) Personality-congruent: LLM-adjusted dialogue based on personality of participants, and (iii) Enhanced interaction: Personality adaptation plus dynamic gestures. For the third condition, we implemented contextually appropriate pre-defined animations and generated novel gestures by computing joint angle values in real time. Statistical analysis using ANOVA revealed significant differences in communication satisfaction across the three conditions (F=13.41, p&lt;.001). Post-hoc analyses using \v{S}id\'{a}k's multiple comparison test showed significant pairwise differences: Condition 2 vs. 1: Δ Δmean 4.42 , p = 0.02; Condition 3 vs. 1: Δ Δmean 8.23, p &lt; 0.01; Condition 3 vs. 2: Δ Δmean 3.80, p = 0.05. These results demonstrate that both personality-congruent interactions and non-verbal gestures significantly enhance communication satisfaction, with the combined approach yielding the highest satisfaction. This approach opens new possibilities for developing socially intelligent robots with applications in healthcare, education, and customer service.},

With their ability to process vast amounts of data, grasp contextual nuances, and engage in human-like dialogue, LLMs present new opportunities and challenges for understanding online interactions. The SocialLLM 2025 workshop builds on the foundation laid by SocialNLP, expanding the scope to explore the capabilities and implications of LLMs in social media research. This year's workshop at TheWebConf 2025 focuses on three pivotal themes: leveraging LLMs for mental health support, enhancing emotion detection in textual interactions, and improving misinformation detection through active learning. The selected papers illustrate cutting-edge advancements in these areas, demonstrating how LLMs can be fine-tuned for therapeutic dialogue generation, assessed for their emotional intelligence, and optimized for misinformation detection with minimal labeled data. These contributions highlight the growing interdisciplinary nature of LLM research, merging insights from natural language processing, social computing, and artificial intelligence ethics. By bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, SocialLLM 2025 aims to foster meaningful discussions on the opportunities and risks associated with LLM-driven social media applications. The workshop serves as a platform for exploring novel methodologies, addressing ethical concerns, and shaping future directions for responsible AI deployment in social media environments. Through collaborative efforts, we seek to advance the field and ensure that LLMs contribute positively to the digital ecosystem.},

abstract = {More efforts are being put into improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) than into dealing with their implications. Current LLMs are able to generate high-quality texts seemingly indistinguishable from those written by human experts. While offering great potential, such breakthroughs also pose new challenges for safe and ethical uses of LLMs in education, science, and a multitude of other areas. Thus, majority of current approaches in LLM text detection are either computationally expensive or need access to the LLMs’ internal computations, both of which hinder their public accessibility. With such motivation, this article presents a novel metric learning paradigm for detection of LLM-generated texts that is able to balance computational costs, accessibility, and performances. Specifically, the detection is based on learning a similarity function between a given text and an equivalent example generated by LLMs that outputs high values for LLM-LLM text pairs and low values for LLM-human text pairs. In terms of architecture, the detection framework includes a pre-trained language model for the text embedding task and a newly designed deep metric model. The metric component can be trained on triplets or pairs of same-context instances to signify the distances between human and LLM texts while reducing that among LLM texts. Next, we develop five datasets totaling more than 95,000 contexts and triplets of responses in which one is from humans and two are from GPT-3.5 TURBO or GPT-4 TURBO for benchmarking. Experiment studies show that our best architectures maintain F1 scores between 0.87 and 0.95 across the tested corpora in multiple experiment settings. The metric framework also demands significantly less time in training and inference compared to RoBERTa, LLaMA 3, Mistral v0.3, and Ghostbuster, while keeping 90% to 150% performance of the best benchmark.},

abstract = {Very large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several natural-language tasks, and show great promise also for code. A particularly exciting aspect of LLMs is their knack for few-shot and zero-shot learning: they can learn to perform a task with very few examples. Few-shotting has particular synergies in software engineering, where there are a lot of phenomena (identifier names, APIs, terminology, coding patterns) that are known to be highly project-specific. However, project-specific data can be quite limited, especially early in the history of a project; thus the few-shot learning capacity of LLMs might be very relevant. In this paper, we investigate the use few-shot training with the very large GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Codex model, and find evidence suggesting that one can significantly surpass state-of-the-art models for code-summarization, leveraging project-specific training.},

This article uses CiteSpace software to conduct a visual analysis of research related to AI in language education from the SCI and SSCI databases over the past five years. The research results indicate that from 2020 to 2024, the number of papers related to AI in language education has been increasing steadily with the improvement of AI technologies. What's more, China, the United States, South Korea, England, and Saudi Arabia are the leading countries in terms of publication volume. Institutions such as the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Education University of Hong Kong, and Indiana University System (including Indiana University Bloomington), etc. have a significant number of publications, and collaborative publications among institutions are the mainstream. Moreover, the keyword co-occurrence graph shows that students’ English learning, large language models, natural language processing technology and deep learning are the foci of scholars' research. Keyword clustering graph and top terms in each cluster indicate that research in this field primarily focuses on English learning, particularly on speech and writing skills, and the psychological factors, learning effect, and learning strategies in the process of AI-assisted language education have also attracted the attention of scholars. Lastly, computational modeling technologies and mobile-assisted language learning are also topics that scholars have discussed extensively. The application of AI in non-English languages education, emotional factors of students and mobile-assisted language education driven by large language models may become hotspots in the future.},

Now, generative AI technologies can suggest new ideas that might never have occurred to the users, and users can then select from these ideas or use them to stimulate even more ideas. To explore these possibilities, we developed a system called Supermind Ideator that uses a large language model (LLM) and adds prompts, fine tuning, and a specialized user interface in order to help users reformulate their problem statements and generate possible solutions. This provides scaffolding to guide users through a set of creative problem-solving techniques, including some techniques specifically intended to help generate innovative ideas about designing groups of people and/or computers (“superminds”). In an experimental study, we found that people using Supermind Ideator generated significantly more innovative ideas than those generated by people using ChatGPT or people working alone. Thus our results suggest that the benefits of using LLMs for creative problem-solving can be substantially enhanced by scaffolding designed specifically for this purpose.},

abstract = {In this work, we explore explicit Large Language Model (LLM)-powered support for the iterative design of computer programs. Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM’s default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM. In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space—but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload. These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.},

abstract = {Automated detection of software failures is an important but challenging software engineering task. It involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing test cases that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to study how far this outstanding challenge can be solved by recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However, our study reveals that ChatGPT has a relatively low success rate (28.8%) in finding correct failure-inducing test cases for buggy programs. A possible conjecture is that finding failure-inducing test cases requires analyzing the subtle differences (nuances) between the tokens of a program's correct version and those for its buggy version. When these two versions have similar sets of tokens and attentions, ChatGPT is weak in distinguishing their differences.We find that ChatGPT can successfully generate failure-inducing test cases when it is guided to focus on the nuances. Our solution is inspired by an interesting observation that ChatGPT could infer the intended functionality of buggy code if it is similar to the correct version. Driven by the inspiration, we develop a novel technique, called Differential Prompting, to effectively find failure-inducing test cases with the help of the compilable code synthesized by the inferred intention. Prompts are constructed based on the nuances between the given version and the synthesized code. We evaluate Differential Prompting on Quixbugs (a popular benchmark of buggy programs) and recent programs published at Codeforces (a popular programming contest portal, which is also an official benchmark of ChatGPT). We compare Differential Prompting with two baselines constructed using conventional ChatGPT prompting and Pynguin (the state-of-the-art unit test generation tool for Python programs). Our evaluation results show that for programs of Quixbugs, Differential Prompting can achieve a success rate of 75.0% in finding failure-inducing test cases, outperforming the best baseline by 2.6X. For programs of Codeforces, Differential Prompting's success rate is 66.7%, outperforming the best baseline by 4.0X.},

abstract = {Three student personas were created, each representing a way in which current students interact with AI tools such as ChatGPT when completing introductory computer science assignments. Four undergraduate students assumed the role of each of the personas in turn and two semesters worth of current assignments were completed in each persona. The results and experiences were then analyzed to determine aspects of the assignments that made it more (or less) difficult to complete them using the AI tools, with an eye towards whether small changes in phrasing or requirements might result in significant changes in this metric.Three of the main takeaways were that LLMs are more difficult for students to use when assignments 1) consist of many small steps, 2) make use of external code libraries, or 3) involve spatial reasoning.Finally, the student/persona experiences helped to generate a list of opportunities for instructors to proactively include the use of AI tools in current assignments without sacrificing any of the current learning objectives.The initial phase involved labs from one institution and used only one AI tool, but follow-up work involving the use of other tools and labs from other institutions validated those core conclusions. A student survey (as well as other published literature) also validated the choice of personas.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently captured the attention of a broad audience. To a large part, their exceptional performance in text generation was made possible by an exponential growth of the model parameters. This growth, however, comes at the expense of significantly higher operational costs and a decreased processing speed. Recent research has focused on running LLMs on commodity hardware, for example, by employing the memory hierarchy to augment throughput by increasing the number of batches. These studies, however, tend to overlook or inefficiently utilize the additional computational resources provided by the CPU. In this paper, we introduce a technique capable of efficiently harnessing all available computational resources through a finely tuned and dynamic workload allocation approach. This technique applies to decoder-based models on standard general-purpose hardware, effectively minimizing idle periods for both the CPU and the GPU. We conducted experiments involving various large language models, each representing distinct decoder-based architectures. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the results demonstrate a potential for an increase of up to 105% in throughput with the OPT-30B model.},

These assistants rely on language models and chat-based user experiences, rendering their evaluation with respect to the quality of the Human-AI conversations complicated. Existing general-purpose metrics for measuring conversational quality found in literature are inadequate for appraising domain-specific dialogues due to their lack of contextual sensitivity.
 
In this paper, we present RUBICON, a technique for evaluating domain-specific Human-AI conversations. RUBICON leverages large language models to generate candidate rubrics for assessing conversation quality and employs a selection process to choose the subset of rubrics based on their performance in scoring conversations. In our experiments, RUBICON effectively learns to differentiate conversation quality, achieving higher accuracy and yield rates than existing baselines.},

abstract = {Architecting software-intensive systems can be a complex process. It deals with the daunting tasks of unifying stakeholders’ perspectives, designers’ intellect, tool-based automation, pattern-driven reuse, and so on, to sketch a blueprint that guides software implementation and evaluation. Despite its benefits, architecture-centric software engineering (ACSE) suffers from a multitude of challenges. ACSE challenges could stem from a lack of standardized processes, socio-technical limitations, and scarcity of human expertise etc. that can impede the development of existing and emergent classes of software. Software Development Bots (DevBots) trained on large language models can help synergise architects’ knowledge with artificially intelligent decision support to enable rapid architecting in a human-bot collaborative ACSE. An emerging solution to enable this collaboration is ChatGPT, a disruptive technology not primarily introduced for software engineering, but is capable of articulating and refining architectural artifacts based on natural language processing. We detail a case study that involves collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT to architect a service-based software. Future research focuses on harnessing empirical evidence about architects’ productivity and explores socio-technical aspects of architecting with ChatGPT to tackle challenges of ACSE.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs), with advanced linguistic capabilities, have been employed in reranking tasks through a sequence-to-sequence approach. In this paradigm, multiple passages are reranked in a listwise manner and a textual reranked permutation is generated. However, due to the limited context window of LLMs, this reranking paradigm requires a sliding window strategy to iteratively handle larger candidate sets. This not only increases computational costs but also restricts the LLM from fully capturing all the comparison information for all candidates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-calibrated listwise reranking method, which aims to leverage LLMs to produce global relevance scores for ranking. To achieve it, we first propose the relevance-aware listwise reranking framework, which incorporates explicit list-view relevance scores to improve reranking efficiency and enable global comparison across the entire candidate set. Second, to ensure the comparability of the computed scores, we propose self-calibrated training that uses point-view relevance assessments generated internally by the LLM itself to calibrate the list-view relevance assessments. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis on the BEIR benchmark and TREC Deep Learning Tracks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.},

By using software tools such as Power BI, SPSS, and Excel, this study conducted a visual analysis of core authors, research funding, research topics, author institutions, discipline areas, and related indicators in the literature. The aim of the study is to analyze the current status of ChatGPT research in higher education applications and to explore the hot issues surrounding ChatGPT empowerment in higher education.The study points out that current research in higher education in the era of artificial intelligence mainly focuses on introducing ChatGPT, the characteristics and connotations of large language models, and discussing the opportunities, challenges, coping strategies, and digital transformation research they bring. However, there is still a lack of in-depth exploration of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education, especially in areas such as personalized learning and precision teaching, the integration of virtual and actual teaching spaces, intelligent teaching facilities and resources, human-computer collaborative teaching methods, and interdisciplinary innovative research methods.We should actively respond to the opportunities and challenges brought by intelligent tools such as ChatGPT to higher education, and comprehensively and deeply explore how to integrate ChatGPT into key areas of digital education, including teaching design, teaching resource development, teaching organization and implementation, teaching evaluation and reflection, learning and personal knowledge management, innovation team building, and enhancing the digital literacy and professional capabilities of teachers and students. In addition, the impact of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education on educational equity, and how to ensure that all students can benefit from it through reasonable design and use, should also be of concern. The goal of this study is to further promote and drive the digital transformation of higher education by building a brand new higher education ecosystem based on ChatGPT.},

abstract = {Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system.To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s).We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.},

abstract = {Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior – in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students (n = 964) solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

With the development of the Internet and big data, natural language processing has become one of the most popular areas in the AI ​​era. Currently, the rise of large-scale pre-trained language models has greatly promoted progress in this field, making the application of natural language processing more extensive and in-depth. This article first reviews the development history of natural language processing, from early rule-based systems to current deep learning-based models. In particular, the proposal of the Transformer architecture marks a major breakthrough in natural language processing technology. It greatly improves the ability to handle long-distance dependencies through the attention mechanism, and has become the basic model for many NLP tasks. Further, this article explores the significant improvements in performance of large-scale pre-trained models such as GPT and BERT, and how they understand and generate language by learning the subtle laws of language on large amounts of text data. Finally, the perspective is returned to large language models, including the development history, performance and challenges of large models, and the introduction of meditation is proposed to solve the problem of model illusion.},

abstract = {High-performance parallel code generation is a complex and fascinating area in computer science that focuses on producing code that executes as quickly and efficiently as possible. In our paper, we designed a new architecture for parallel code generation agent with 4 inter-connected components of LLM---Memory, Planning, Tools and Action. It also incooperated with two techniques: data augmentation, prompting and retrieval-augmented editing to improve the performance of the parallel codes. Data augmentation is implemented by extracting and processing PIE dataset, and also synthesis dataset generated by LLM models with ParEval benchmark. Finally planning-oriented prompting, code verification and retrieval augmented editing are used to promote the actual performance of the LLM generated code. The evaluation results confirm that a rough speedup of 6.06X and 5.13X are achieved using Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct LLM models.},

abstract = {Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks introduces concerns about computational efficiency, prompting an exploration of efficient methods such as In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the vulnerability of ICL to privacy attacks under realistic assumptions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first membership inference attack tailored for ICL, relying solely on generated texts without their associated probabilities. We propose four attack strategies tailored to various constrained scenarios and conduct extensive experiments on four popular large language models. Empirical results show that our attacks can accurately determine membership status in most cases, e.g., 95% accuracy advantage against LLaMA, indicating that the associated risks are much higher than those shown by existing probability-based attacks. Additionally, we propose a hybrid attack that synthesizes the strengths of the aforementioned strategies, achieving an accuracy advantage of over 95% in most cases. Furthermore, we investigate three potential defenses targeting data, instruction, and output. Results demonstrate combining defenses from orthogonal dimensions significantly reduces privacy leakage and offers enhanced privacy assurances.},

Now, generative AI technologies can suggest new ideas that might never have occurred to the users, and users can then select from these ideas or use them to stimulate even more ideas. To explore these possibilities, we developed a system called Supermind Ideator that uses a large language model (LLM) and adds prompts, fine tuning, and a specialized user interface in order to help users reformulate their problem statements and generate possible solutions. This provides scaffolding to guide users through a set of creative problem-solving techniques, including some techniques specifically intended to help generate innovative ideas about designing groups of people and/or computers (“superminds”). In an experimental study, we found that people using Supermind Ideator generated significantly more innovative ideas than those generated by people using ChatGPT or people working alone. Thus our results suggest that the benefits of using LLMs for creative problem-solving can be substantially enhanced by scaffolding designed specifically for this purpose.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a state-of-the-art learning model with a wide range of applications in diverse computing environments. Among the various computational operations that comprise the LLM, the GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation is the most frequently utilized operation within the LLM. GEMM libraries such as cuBLAS and CUTLASS provide a variety of optimization techniques to achieve optimal GEMM performance in GPU-enabled computing environments. In particular, the CUTLASS open-source library for GPUs within the CUDA programming environment provides users with the capability to optimize templates for high performance. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of CUTLASS-based GEMMs in improving the performance of real-world deep neural networks on various deep learning platforms. However, these studies have not considered different model parameters for modern LLMs nor have they explored the impact of diverse GPU computing environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                This paper presents CUrator, an efficient LLM execution engine that can achieve optimal end-to-end LLM performance using both cuBLAS and CUTLASS libraries on different GPUs for modern LLMs such as BERT, GPT, and Llama. CUrator first generates CUTLASS-/cuBLAS-friendly graph IRs of various LLMs on the TVM framework to maximize mapping coverage. On the CUTLASS mapping path, it performs a comprehensive search for programmable tuning parameters in the CUTLASS library with the objective of deriving optimal kernels for all GEMMs within each LLM. CUrator further introduces two optimization techniques: 1) build-time reduction key initialization support for CUTLASS Split-K GEMMs, and 2) Split-K support for CUTLASS Batch GEMMs. Finally, CUrator selects the best performing mapping path between cuBLAS and CUTLASS paths. The experimental results show that CUrator achieves inference speedups of 1.50\texttimes{} and 4.99\texttimes{}, respectively, for representative LLMs on the A100 GPU in the single and half precision, compared to the baseline. We strongly believe that the CUrator framework can provide the best direction for next-generation tuning frameworks by showing the maximum end-to-end performance of various LLMs on various GPUs.},

These Questions about Learners' Code (QLCs) are created through program analysis, exploring execution paths, and then creating code comprehension questions from these paths and the broader code structure. Responding to the questions requires reading and tracing the code, which is known to support students' learning. At the same time, computing education researchers have witnessed the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have taken the community by storm. Researchers have demonstrated the applicability of these models especially in the introductory programming context, outlining their performance in solving introductory programming problems and their utility in creating new learning resources. In this work, we explore the capability of the state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in answering QLCs that are generated from code that the LLMs have created. Our results show that although the state-of-the-art LLMs can create programs and trace program execution when prompted, they easily succumb to similar errors that have previously been recorded for novice programmers. These results demonstrate the fallibility of these models and perhaps dampen the expectations fueled by the recent LLM hype. At the same time, we also highlight future research possibilities such as using LLMs to mimic students as their behavior can indeed be similar for some specific tasks.},

abstract = {Automatic testing has garnered significant attention and success over the past few decades. Techniques such as unit testing and coverage-guided fuzzing have revealed numerous critical software bugs and vulnerabilities. However, a long-standing, formidable challenge for existing techniques is how to achieve higher testing coverage. Constraint-based techniques, such as symbolic execution and concolic testing, have been well-explored and integrated into the existing approaches. With the popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research efforts to design tailored prompts to generate inputs that can reach more uncovered target branches. However, the effectiveness of using LLMs for generating such directed inputs and the comparison with the proven constraint-based solutions has not been systematically explored.To bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study on the mainstream LLMs and constraint-based tools for directed input generation with a comparative perspective. We find that LLMs such as ChatGPT are comparable to or even better than the constraint-based tools, succeeding in 43.40%-58.57% samples in our dataset. Meanwhile, there are also limitations for LLMs in specific scenarios such as sequential calculation, where constraint-based tools are in a position of strength. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method to combine these two types of tools and implement a prototype based on ChatGPT and constraint-based tools. Our evaluation shows that our approach can outperform the baselines by 1.4x to 2.3x relatively. We believe our study can provide novel insights into directed input generation using LLMs, and our findings are essential for future testing research.},

abstract = {Gamification has gained significant attention in the last decade for its potential to enhance engagement and motivation in various domains. During the last year ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model has received even more attention both in the field of scientific research and in common use by individuals or companies.  
In this study, we investigate the possibility of adopting ChatGPT as a tool for designing gamification platforms in the Software Engineering domain. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we assess how good is it at generating effective suggestions and ideas for designers or developers.  
To evaluate ChatGPT's potential as a gamification platform creator we narrowed the context to one particular Software Engineering activity, asking for possible aspects of the activity to be gamified. Each proposed aspect was subsequently unraveled by ChatGPT both asking in a shared and separate context, first following the conversational nature of the model, then applying a validated design framework. The study assesses ChatGPT's ability to select and integrate game elements to build a thriving gamification environment by framing the design of the platform to a state-of-the-art conceptual framework. To evaluate the goodness of the design choices made we relied both on the Octalysis framework and on personal experience.  
The findings of the papers show that ChatGPT can only create simple playful experiences not very effective. Although, by instructing the model with more specific desired mechanics and dynamics, it is possible to guide it toward the application of the ideas suggested. We argue that ChatGPT is not capable of building a gamified environment on its own, but it could still be used to build the foundation of a gamification platform as long as the designers refine and rough out the advice gained from a user-centered solution.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on edge devices learn through fine-tuning and updating a certain portion of their parameters. Although such learning methods can be optimized to reduce resource utilization, the overall required resources remain a heavy burden on edge devices. Instead, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a resource-efficient LLM learning method, can improve the quality of the LLM-generated content without updating model parameters. However, the RAG-based LLM may involve repetitive searches on the profile data in every user-LLM interaction. This search can lead to significant latency along with the accumulation of user data. Conventional efforts to decrease latency result in restricting the size of saved user data, thus reducing the scalability of RAG as user data continuously grows. It remains an open question: how to free RAG from the constraints of latency and scalability on edge devices? In this paper, we propose a novel framework to accelerate RAG via Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures. It accelerates matrix multiplications by performing in-situ computation inside the memory while avoiding the expensive data transfer between the computing unit and memory. Our framework, Robust CiM-backed RAG (RoCR), utilizing a novel contrastive learning-based training method and noise-aware training, can enable RAG to efficiently search profile data with CiM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing CiM to accelerate RAG.},

abstract = {Software development life cycle is profoundly influenced by bugs; their introduction, identification, and eventual resolution account for a significant portion of software development cost. This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose : a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs.  combines a Retriever – transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator – an LLM (12 billion parameter Codex Cushman model) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via adding bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated , a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that  outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java. We discuss the deployment of  alongside Infer at Microsoft which offers an end-to-end solution for detection, classification, and localization of bugs, as well as fixing and validation of candidate patches, integrated in the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate the software development workflow.},

The study identifies key themes such as the evolving nature of human-AI interaction, the capabilities of AI in software engineering tasks, and the challenges and limitations of integrating AI in this domain. The findings show that while AI, particularly ChatGPT, improves the efficiency of code generation and optimization, human oversight remains crucial, especially in areas requiring complex problem-solving and security considerations. This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of human-AI collaboration in software engineering and provides practical insights for effectively integrating AI tools into development processes. It highlights the need for clear role allocation, effective communication, and balanced AI-human collaboration to realize the full potential of AI in software engineering.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective in computer hardware synthesis via hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is nowadays widely used for different purposes and with several disciplines. From self-driving cars to automated medical diagnosis, machine learning models extensively support users’ daily activities, and software engineering tasks are no exception. Not embracing good ML practices may lead to pitfalls that hinder the performance of an ML system and potentially lead to unexpected results. Despite the existence of documentation and literature about ML best practices, many non-ML experts turn towards gray literature like blogs and Q&amp;A systems when looking for help and guidance when implementing ML systems. To better aid users in distilling relevant knowledge from such sources, we propose a recommender system that recommends ML practices based on the user’s context. As a first step in creating a recommender system for machine learning practices, we implemented Idaka. A tool that provides two different approaches for retrieving/generating ML best practices: i) an information retrieval (IR) engine and ii) a large language model. The IR-engine uses BM25 as the algorithm for retrieving the practices, and a large language model, in our case Alpaca. The platform has been designed to allow comparative studies of best practices retrieval tools. Idaka is publicly available at  GitHub: https://bit.ly/idaka. Video: https://youtu.be/cEb-AhIPxnM},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing conversational recommender systems (CRS) by effectively indexing item content, understanding complex conversational contexts, and generating relevant item titles. However, the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which outputs item titles as a long sequence of subtokens, hinders the ability to efficiently obtain and control recommendations across the entire item set. This challenge in calculating probabilities over all items limits LLMs' potential, such as (1) limiting control over recommendation popularities and (2) preventing the synergy of marrying LLMs and traditional recommender systems (RecSys).To address this challenge, we propose the Reindex-Then-Adapt (RTA) framework. It consists of two steps: (1) Reindex: a lightweight network learns to condense multi-token item titles into single tokens within the LLM and distills LLM-generated recommendations as ranked lists. This bypasses the autoregressive nature of LLMs while trying to preserve their CRS abilities; (2) Adapt: LLMs after reindexing enable efficient adjustment of probability distributions over single-token titles, further enhanced through RecSys integration. RTA bridges the strengths of LLMs and RecSys, enabling understanding of complex queries as LLMs do, while efficiently controlling recommended item distributions as in traditional RecSys. We show the effectiveness of our RTA over base LLMs across three CRS datasets with negligible additional parameters.},

abstract = {Deep learning tasks, especially those involving complex convolution neural networks (CNNs), are computationally intensive and pose significant challenges when implemented on hardware. Accelerating these tasks is critical for improving performance. High-level Synthesis (HLS) has the potential to automate the efficient hardware accelerator designs directly from high-level C/C++ specification of trained machine learning (ML) models. Traditional HLS tools cannot synthesize certain high-level constructs, which require manual intervention. Many source code optimizations and the selection of pragmas for HLS optimizations are crucial for generating efficient hardware accelerators with HLS. However, both of these tasks are mostly manual efforts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. In this work, we explore the application of LLMs to remove these manual efforts in adapting HLS for ML accelerator designs. Our framework called LLM-assisted HLS, i.e., LHS, uses LLMs to automate the resolution of synthesis issues, ensuring compatibility with HLS tools. Furthermore, our framework automates the source code modification and optimization selection through pragma insertion steps, which are crucial for optimizing the synthesized design. Our experimental results with LHS demonstrate a significant improvement in latency for deep learning tasks with underlying complex CNN models without much area overhead. Our LHS allows us to achieve up to 2690 \texttimes{} latency improvement. Promisingly, LHS performs better than the state-of-the-art ML accelerator design tool hls4ml in 4 out of 6 cases in the context of latency improvement at the expense of area overhead (i.e., performance to hardware gain). This work highlights the potential of LLMs to assist and accelerate the HLS process, thereby creating more efficient hardware implementation for deep learning models.},

abstract = {As AI tools like ChatGPT become more prevalent in educational settings, their potential to assist undergraduate teaching assistants (uTAs) in large Computer Science 2 (CS2) courses presents both opportunities and challenges. This work focuses on how ChatGPT can be strategically utilized by uTAs during office hours to enhance student support, particularly in complex topics such as data structures, algorithm development, and object-oriented programming. We explored effective strategies for uTAs to use ChatGPT in ways that promote deeper student understanding without compromising the development of independent problem-solving skills. Key strategies include leveraging ChatGPT for real-time code debugging assistance, offering alternative approaches to solving coding problems, comparing and critiquing self and AI generated documentation, and code reviewing. This work also identifies potential challenges, such as the risk of students or uTAs becoming overly dependent on AI-generated solutions and the possibility of inaccurate or incomplete responses from the AI. Hence, our findings highlight the dual role of ChatGPT as both an asset and a potential hindrance, depending on how it is utilized. To mitigate these risks, we propose a set of best practices that ensure ChatGPT enhances, rather than replaces, the uTA's role as a facilitator of learning. The findings from this research provide valuable insights into how uTAs can integrate AI tools thoughtfully into office hours to offer more effective support, ultimately improving student engagement and learning outcomes in large-scale CS2 courses.},

abstract = {While GPU-based placers have demonstrated significant speed advantages over their CPU-based counterparts, hyperparameter tuning remains a bottleneck, often requiring substantial human intervention and expert knowledge. This challenge is particularly critical given the urgent need for rapid time-to-market solutions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in zero-shot learning, context understanding, logical reasoning, and answer generation. In this work, we introduce HyperPlace, an innovative paradigm that leverages an off-the-shelf LLM to automate hyperparameter optimization using in-context learning techniques. Our approach transcends single-output black-box optimization methods by incorporating a batch optimization mechanism that evaluates multiple hyperparameter configurations simultaneously across several GPU computing platforms. We validated the effectiveness of our approach in placement quality, measured by Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL), using DREAMPlace 2.0. To further demonstrate the capability of integrating our framework with other placers, we conducted additional experiments using Xplace 2.0. By employing the ISPD2005 benchmarks for our evaluation, HyperPlace enhances the placement tools with up to a 1.66% reduction in HPWL compared to their published results. Additionally, we evaluated HyperPlace on the ISPD2015 benchmarks, which incorporate fence region constraints not present in ISPD2005 benchmarks. Under these more complex constraints, HyperPlace achieves up to a 22.24% reduction in HPWL compared to the default settings of the placement tools, further demonstrating its adaptability across diverse placement scenarios and benchmark suites.},

abstract = {Context: Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering (SE). However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks. Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs. Objective: Our objective is to investigate the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by (1) simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and (2) automating title-abstract screening entirely. Method: We performed an experiment where human screeners performed title-abstract screening for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR. The experiment with human screeners was reproduced by instructing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks. We also studied whether different prompting techniques (Zero-shot (ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT) prompting) improve the screening performance of LLMs. Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of title-abstract screening leads to improved screening performance. Results: Text simplification did not increase the screeners’ screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening. Screeners’ scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. Our results indicate that a more recent LLM (GPT-4) is better than its predecessor LLM (GPT-3.5). Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. Conclusion: Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance. Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners. To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed. We recommend future SR studies to publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.},

abstract = {Homomorphic encryption is one of the main solutions for building secure and privacy-preserving solutions for Machine Learning as a Service, a major challenge in a society where AI becomes more and more pervasive. This motivates the development of homomorphic algorithms for the main building blocks of AI, typically for the components of the various types of neural networks architectures.Among those components, we focus on the Softmax function, defined by Softmax(x ) = (exp(xi) / ∑j=1n exp(xj))1 ≤ i ≤ n. This function is deemed to be one of the most difficult to evaluate homomorphically, because of its multivariate nature and of the very large range of values for exp(xi). The available homomorphic algorithms remain restricted, especially in large dimensions, while important applications such as Large Language Models (LLM) require computing Softmax over large dimensional vectors. Our algorithm has strong scalability properties in terms of range and dimension while maintaining very good numerical accuracy. In terms of multiplicative depth of the computation (a suitable measure of cost for homomorphic algorithms), our algorithm achieves O(log n) complexity for a fixed range of inputs, where n is the Softmax dimension.Our algorithm is especially adapted to the situation where we must compute many Softmax at the same time, for instance, in the LLM situation. In that case, assuming that all Softmax calls are packed into m ciphtertexts, the asymptotic amortized multiplicative depth cost per ciphertext is, again over a fixed range, O(1 + m/N) for N the homomorphic ring degree (typically N=216, so that we have N ≫ m in practice).The main ingredient of our algorithms is a normalize-and-square strategy, which manages to interlace the (numerically unstable) exponential computation over a large range and (very expensive) normalization, decomposing both in stabler and cheaper smaller steps.We have implemented our algorithms using the HEaaN implementation of the CKKS HE system. Comparing ourselves to the state of the art, our experiments show, in practice, a gain of a factor 2.5 to 8 compared to state of the art solutions.These experiments demonstrate good accuracy (around 16-bit precision in the worst case, around 20 on average) and support the linear behavior in the dimension. The many-ciphertexts version allows us to compute 8192 Softmax of dimension 256 in parallel in 486s (single-thread CPU), corresponding to an amortized 0.06s per Softmax call. All Softmax calls of the 32-layers LLaMa large language model (7B version) with context length 128 on an RTX-6000 GPU take around 1.5 minutes, and the final Softmax call in dimension 32768 for token generation takes less than 3 seconds. This suggests that near-practicality may be accessible with dedicated hardware.},

abstract = {On-Chip Variation (OCV)-aware and Path-Based Analysis (PBA) accurate timing optimization achieved by gate sizing (including Vth-assignment) remains a pivotal step in modern signoff. However, in advanced nodes (e.g., 3nm), commercial tools often yield suboptimal results due to the intricate design demands and the vast choices of library cells that require substantial runtime and computational resources for exploration. To address these challenges, we introduce LEGO-Size, a generative framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and GPU-accelerated differentiable techniques for efficient gate sizing. LEGO-Size introduces three key innovations. First, it considers timing paths as sequences of tokenized library cells, casting gate sizing prediction as a language modeling task and solving it with self-supervised learning and supervised fine-tuning. Second, it employs a Graph Transformer (GT) with a linear-complexity attention mechanism for netlist encoding, enabling LLMs to make sizing decisions from a global perspective. Third, it integrates a differentiable Static Timing Analysis (STA) engine to refine LLM-predicted gate size probabilities by directly optimizing Total Negative Slack (TNS) through gradient descent. Experimental results on 5 unseen million-gate industrial designs in a commercial 3nm node show that LEGO-Size achieves up to 125x speed up with 37% TNS improvement over an industry-leading commercial signoff tool with minimal power and area overhead.},

This tutorial is designed to review the latest progress of several critical areas in computational advertising: matching, prediction, auction and bidding. Particularly, with the recent advances in generative AI such as large language models, there is a growing interest in further enhancing these areas with these techniques. In this tutorial, we first introduce the recent advances in matching, including its architecture alternatives, model developments, and how it co-evolves with the ad products which distinguishes itself from that in recommendation products. We then review the recent advances in prediction, with a focus on topics such as feature interactions, user interest models, and multi-task/domain learning. We will show how these building bricks constitute large prediction models and LLM-enhanced/LLM-based prediction models. Then, we discuss auction and bidding, a unique area in computational advertising. Both traditional and learning-based auctions will be introduced, followed by their applications in real-world ad products. Given the auction designs, we show how bidding evolves from control-based, to reinforcement learning-based, and most recently to generative AI-based. Our aim is to help the audience grasp the recent developments in computational advertising, as well as to spark inspiration for future research.},

abstract = {In the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm, demonstrating their potential as a transformative force in many domains including computing education. Computing education researchers have found that LLMs can solve most assessments in introductory programming courses, including both traditional code writing tasks and other popular tasks such as Parsons problems. As more and more students start to make use of LLMs, the question instructors might ask themselves is "what can I do?". We propose that one promising way forward is to integrate LLMs into teaching practice, providing all students with an equal opportunity to learn how to interact productively with LLMs as well as encounter and understand their limitations. In this workshop, we first present state-of-the-art research results on how to utilize LLMs in computing education practice, after which participants will take part in hands-on activities using LLMs. We end the workshop by brainstorming ideas with participants around adapting their classrooms to most effectively integrate LLMs while avoiding some common pitfalls.},

abstract = {As Computational Thinking (CT) continues to permeate younger age groups in K-12 education, established CT platforms such as Scratch face challenges in catering to these younger learners, particularly those in the elementary school (ages 6-12). Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children’s autonomous Scratch learning: artist’s block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist’s block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance. Our study shows that, compared to Scratch, ChatScratch efficiently fosters autonomous programming learning, and contributes to the creation of high-quality, personally meaningful Scratch projects for children.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely used for code generation. Due to the complexity and opacity of LLMs, little is known about how these models generate code. We made the first attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating whether LLMs attend to the same parts of a task description as human programmers during code generation. An analysis of six LLMs, including GPT-4, on two popular code generation benchmarks revealed a consistent misalignment between LLMs' and programmers' attention. We manually analyzed 211 incorrect code snippets and found five attention patterns that can be used to explain many code generation errors. Finally, a user study showed that model attention computed by a perturbation-based method is often favored by human programmers. Our findings highlight the need for human-aligned LLMs for better interpretability and programmer trust.},

abstract = {Chest X-ray imaging plays a critical role in diagnosing chest diseases, making it a cornerstone in clinical and research domains. Automating disease diagnosis and extracting relevant clinical information from chest X-ray reports have become essential for developing AI-driven healthcare systems. While effective, deep learning models require extensive labelled datasets, making the labelling of diseases from radiology reports crucial. Traditionally, rule-based labelling approaches have been employed, but the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new possibilities through instruction-based prompt engineering. In this study, we explore various prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning and prompt chaining, to label multilabel disease reports and extract key clinical findings from radiology reports. We conducted ablation studies on both proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) and publicly available LLMs (e.g., Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, Llama3-8B, Llama2-70B), comparing their performance in terms of clinical accuracy, privacy, and computational cost. Our findings demonstrate that well-crafted prompts on publicly available and lightweight LLMs can achieve competitive results compared to larger and/or proprietary models, offering a cost-effective and privacy-preserving solution for clinical applications. These results highlight the potential of leveraging advanced prompt engineering to streamline disease labelling and enhance the quality of automated report generation in radiology.},

abstract = {Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to  (84.5% )  of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model’s practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.},

abstract = {Consistent, diverse, and quality contributions are essential to the sustainability of the open source community. Therefore, it is important that there is infrastructure for effectively onboarding and retaining diverse newcomers to open source software projects. Most often, open source projects rely on onboarding documentation to support newcomers in making their first contributions. Unfortunately, prior studies suggest that information overload from available documentation, along with the predominantly monolingual nature of repositories, can have negative effects on the newcomer experiences and onboarding process. This, coupled with the effort involved in creating and maintaining onboarding documentation, suggest a need for support in creating more accessible documentation. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in providing text transformation support in other domains, and even shown promise in simplifying or generating other kinds of computing artifacts, such as source code and technical documentation. We contend that LLMs can also help make software onboarding documentation more accessible, thereby reducing the potential for information overload. Using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) and Gemini Pro as case studies, we assessed the effectiveness of LLMs for simplifying software onboarding documentation, one method for reducing information overload. We discuss a broader vision for using LLMs to support the creation of more accessible documentation and outline future research directions toward this vision.},

The advent of advanced natural language processing models, such as ChatGPT, has sparked interest in their potential to automate tasks traditionally performed by humans, including the generation of use case descriptions in software engineering. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in generating use case descriptions is crucial for software engineers. Without a clear understanding of its performance, practitioners may either overestimate its utility, leading to reliance on suboptimal drafts, or underestimate its capabilities, missing opportunities to streamline the drafting process. This paper addresses how well ChatGPT performs in generating use case descriptions, evaluating their quality compared to human-written descriptions. To do so, we employ a structured approach using established quality guidelines and the concept of "bad smells" for use case descriptions. Our study presents the first attempt to bridge the knowledge gap by offering a comparative analysis of ChatGPT-generated and human-written use case descriptions. By providing an approach to objectively assess ChatGPT's performance, we highlight its potential and limitations, offering software engineers insights to effectively integrate AI tools into their workflows.},

To address this gap, we introduce a novel food computing foundation model that achieves true multimodality, encompassing tasks such as t2t, t2i, i2t, it2t, and t2ti. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, our model can perform a diverse array of food computing-related tasks, including food understanding, food recognition, recipe generation, and food image generation. Compared to previous models, our foundation model demonstrates a significantly broader range of capabilities and exhibits superior performance, particularly in food image generation and recipe generation tasks.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has expanded its influence far beyond traditional boundaries in our society. One prominent application of artificial intelligence is the use of large language models, which have transcended their initial roles in high-tech industries and academic research and are now actively utilized by individual users. These models have continually improved over the years in their generative capabilities and performance across numerous tasks. However, they still pose a persistent risk of reproducing biases and stereotypes. Previous research has predominantly focused on quantitatively measuring biases in these large language models. In this study, we seek to assess not just the presence of bias itself, but the perception of stereotypes by these models via in-depth exploration of their responses. We demonstrate how the computational grounded theory framework, which integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, can be applied in this context to assess the conceptualization of stereotypes. Furthermore, we contrast language model results with a survey of 400 human participants who also completed similar prompts as the model in order to understand people’s perception of gender stereotypes. The results indicate substantial similarities between language model and human perceptions of stereotypes, highlighting that a model’s perception stems from societal perception of stereotypes.},

Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance AI-CDSS, but haven’t been studied in either simulated or real-world clinical scenarios. We present findings from a randomized controlled trial deploying AI-CDSS for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with and without an LLM interface within realistic clinical simulations for physician and medical student participants. We find evidence that LLM augmentation improves ease-of-use, that LLM-generated responses with citations improve trust, and HCI varies based on clinical expertise.

abstract = {Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life, many opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence. Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a specific area: responding to student programmers’ help requests. More specifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic code that students request help on. Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online programming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and GPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students’ code and assessed the LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently find at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90% of the cases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57% of the time). False positives are common (40% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice that the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better on issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model solutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM responses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than responses to English prompts. Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in programming education. At the same time, the results highlight the unreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do, perhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment systems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future efforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning (RLFT) has emerged as a crucial workload for enhancing large language models (LLMs). RLFT workflows are challenging, involving nested loops, multiple models, dynamically shaped tensors and interleaving sequential generation and parallel inference tasks. Despite these complexities, current RLFT engines rely on coarse-grained algorithm representations, treating each component as an independently optimized black-box. As a result, RLFT engines suffer from redundant computations, scheduling overhead, inefficient memory management, and missed opportunities for parallelism.We argue that a fine-grained representation is needed to enable holistic optimization for RLFT workloads. Additionally, we demonstrate that existing declarative deep learning engines fail to optimize RLFT workloads end-to-end due to their need for static tensor shapes and loop bounds, leading to excessive peak memory usage and unnecessary computations. Through micro-benchmarks, we quantify these inefficiencies and show that addressing them could enable more efficient and flexible execution. We propose an RLFT system design based on a fine-granularity representation, opening the door to generalizable optimizations, and paving the way for more scalable and efficient RLFT systems.},

abstract = {Powerful foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), with Transformer architectures have ushered in a new era of Generative AI across various industries. Industry and research community have witnessed a large number of new applications, based on those foundation models. Such applications include question and answer, customer services, image and video generation, and code completions, among others. However, as the number of model parameters reaches to hundreds of billions, their deployment incurs prohibitive inference costs and high latency in real-world scenarios. As a result, the demand for cost-effective and fast inference using AI accelerators is ever more higher. To this end, our tutorial offers a comprehensive discussion on complementary inference optimization techniques using AI accelerators. Beginning with an overview of basic Transformer architectures and deep learning system frameworks, we deep dive into system optimization techniques for fast and memory-efficient attention computations and discuss how they can be implemented efficiently on AI accelerators. Next, we describe architectural elements that are key for fast transformer inference. Finally, we examine various model compression and fast decoding strategies in the same context.},

abstract = {The introduction of Leaving Certificate Computer Science (LCCS) in Ireland in 2018 signifies a notable advancement in post-primary education. Moreover, developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education, are gaining prominence, yet we do not understand its value or how best to implement it in post-primary educational settings. Despite a growing international body of research in this area, my scoping review highlights that many aspects of these topics have yet to be explored, particularly in the context of post-primary students in Ireland. My study will begin to bridge this gap by exploring how a purposeful sample of LCCS post-primary students in Ireland engage with GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, during their initial experiences learning Python programming. These findings, when approached through the lens of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI), can help enhance pedagogical strategies and lead to improved learning experiences for students.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that AI-driven code generation tools, such as Large Language Models, are able to solve most of the problems usually presented in introductory programming classes. However, it is still unknown how they cope with Object Oriented Programming assignments, where the students are asked to design and implement several interrelated classes (either by composition or inheritance) that follow a set of best-practices. Since the majority of the exercises in these tools' training dataset are written in English, it is also unclear how well they function with exercises published in other languages.In this paper, we report our experience using GPT-3 to solve 6 real-world tasks used in an Object Oriented Programming course at a Portuguese University and written in Portuguese. Our observations, based on an objective evaluation of the code, performed by an open-source Automatic Assessment Tool, show that GPT-3 is able to interpret and handle direct functional requirements, however it tends not to give the best solution in terms of object oriented design. We perform a qualitative analysis of GPT-3's output, and gather a set of recommendations for computer science educators, since we expect students to use and abuse this tool in their academic work.},

abstract = {Our study investigates the effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, to generate responses to student reflections. Acknowledging the intensive nature of manually handling reflections, our investigation centers on crafting prompts to automate reflection response generation. Driven by fast and meaningful response generation to student reflections, we explored both Zero-Shot learning (ZSL) and Few-Shot learning (FSL) methodologies. Our research meticulously examined the facets of each approach, highlighting the significance of consistent and meaningful responses.The Few-Shot prompting approach involves creating a fundamental prompt based on reflection questions and desired responses, striving for consistency while facing challenges such as GPT-3.5 computational time and issues related to content "hallucinations." In contrast, Zero-Shot prompting utilizes the base prompt and response without the assistance of examples. The evaluation process entails a meticulous examination of the quality of GPT-3.5 responses compared to the original student reflections.In the future, our study foresees integrating our devised prompting techniques as a resource for educators to promptly grasp students' learning concerns and issues. Despite challenges, Few-Shot prompting stands out as the more reliable and relevant approach, particularly in the context of email-based formats. As Machine Learning and AI continue to advance, overcoming challenges and adjusting to fluctuations in student emotions and content remains a pivotal factor in fully harnessing the capabilities of LLMs for automating the generation of responses to student reflections.},

abstract = {Having spent the past year post-retirement working with my alma mater, New Mexico State University's (NMSU) Computer Science department to broaden computing, increase student engagement, and to improve graduation completion, as well as reflecting on the state of computing in society at large, I thought I'd share some observations. In March of this year, I had the opportunity to participate in the SIGCSE 2022 Technical Symposium. I was struck by Dr. Shaundra Daily's plenary keynote, entitled "Diversifying Computing: Real Change Must Come from Within", and her use of the phrase "navigating systems that were not designed for me" as she described her exploration of STEM as a first-generation college student, as both a dance and an engineering student, and as a graduate student preparing for motherhood lacking flexibility during her pregnancy, no maternity leave, no livable stipend, and a lack of affordable childcare, as well as the coping strategies she needed to develop to deal with academic culture. In my work with NMSU this past spring, co-teaching a problem solving course, my work this fall advising CS students, and my board roles serving on the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Roundtable for Systemic Change in Undergraduate STEM Education co-chairing the "Culture of STEM" workgroup, on the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institution's (CAHSI) Advisory Board, and on the Computing Research Association for Widening Participation (CRA-WP), co-editing the "Expanding the Pipeline" column, it's clear that system design adversely impacts society in terms of determining not only who gets to participate in the design of computer hardware and software, but also who gets to advance in social and economic mobility. Academic institutions are complex systems in need of an overhaul, by the University of California's academic workers strike for better pay and benefits. The design and commercialization of AI without fully understanding the implications of bias and ethics is inherently a system design problem. The application to everything from AI generated art and images (and how to spot deep fakes), the ability of large language models (LLMs) to create volumes of text generated articles that appear legitimate with the capacity to spread hate and misinformation globally are but just a few examples of the potentially horrific impact to society, because humans cannot work at the pace and scale to validate and/or authenticate them, with few if any meaningful domestic and international laws or policies in place to safeguard us.},

While some oppose their use, many researchers have begun to approach the topic of educational AI use from a different perspective. Despite being in its early stages; this field of research has produced notable insights into the capabilities and limitations of models like ChatGPT. This paper utilizes a SWOT analysis framework to analyze and consolidate existing literature, with a specific focus on Computer Science education. Through the analysis of this literature, we have created a set of use cases and guidelines to aid in the future development of strategies and tools within this field.

abstract = {The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by the prominence of large language models (LLMs), has ushered in fundamental transformations across the globe. However, alongside these advancements, concerns surrounding the legitimacy of LLMs have grown, posing legal challenges to their extensive applications. Compounding these concerns, the parameters of LLMs are often treated as intellectual property, restricting direct investigations.In this study, we address a fundamental challenge within the realm of AI legislation: the need to establish the authenticity of outputs generated by LLMs. To tackle this issue, we present zkLLM, which stands as the inaugural specialized zero-knowledge proof tailored for LLMs to the best of our knowledge. Addressing the persistent challenge of non-arithmetic operations in deep learning, we introduce tlookup, a parallelized lookup argument designed for non-arithmetic tensor operations in deep learning, offering a solution with no asymptotic overhead. Furthermore, leveraging the foundation of tlookup, we introduce zkAttn, a specialized zero-knowledge proof crafted for the attention mechanism, carefully balancing considerations of running time, memory usage, and accuracy.Empowered by our fully parallelized CUDA implementation, zkLLM emerges as a significant stride towards achieving efficient zero-knowledge verifiable computations over LLMs. Remarkably, for LLMs boasting 13 billion parameters, our approach enables the generation of a correctness proof for the entire inference process in under 15 minutes. The resulting proof, compactly sized at less than 200 kB, is designed to uphold the privacy of the model parameters, ensuring no inadvertent information leakage.},

abstract = {Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are currently an extremely active research topic for the multimedia and computer vision communities, and show a significant impact in visual analysis and text generation tasks. MLLM's are well-versed in integrated understanding, analysis of complex data from cross modalities (i.e. text-image) and text generation with chat abilities. Almost all MLLM's, focus on alignment of image features to textual features for downstream text generation tasks includes detailed image description, visual question answering, stories and poems generation, phrase grounding, etc.. However, when focusing on visual question answering, questions that are highly relevant to the context of an image may not be answered correctly with the existing MLLM's, contrary to questions that are related to visual aspects. Moreover, generating meta data (context) for an image using present day MLLM's is hard task due to hallucinating characteristic of underlying Large Language Models (LLM's), and adequate contextual information cannot be directly derived from an image based perspective.Considering the cultural heritage domain, these issues hamper the introduction of multimedia chatbots as tools to support learning and understanding artworks, since contextual information is typically needed to better understand the content of the artworks themselves, and museum curators require that scientifically accurate information is provided to the users of such systems. In this paper we present a system that combines contextual description of the artworks to enhance the contextual visual question answering task.},

However, knowing whether a text was produced by human or artificial intelligence (AI) is important to determining its trustworthiness, and has applications in many domains including detecting fraud and academic dishonesty, as well as combating the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. The task of AI-generated text (AIGT) detection is therefore both very challenging, and highly critical. In this survey, we summarize stateof-the art approaches to AIGT detection, including watermarking, statistical and stylistic analysis, and machine learning classification. We also provide information about existing datasets for this task. Synthesizing the research findings, we aim to provide insight into the salient factors that combine to determine how “detectable” AIGT text is under different scenarios, and to make practical recommendations for future work towards this significant technical and societal challenge.},

abstract = {Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, has garnered attention in computer science education. This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey.With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.},

Many existing approaches rely on Ekman’s universal emotions theory, which reduces emotions to static categories, neglecting their complexity and contextual variability. This work introduces a novel, context-aware approach based on Lisa Feldman Barrett’s Theory of Constructed Emotion. A key contribution is the development of the “context sphere,” a personalized construct derived from user behavior data. To our knowledge, this is the first operationalization for computational methods. A context-aware emotion analysis pipeline was developed, incorporating advanced Large Language Model (LLM) prompting strategies like role-play and controlled generation. A case study in content moderation demonstrates how the “context sphere” enables contextually aware emotion analyses. Future directions include refining the framework, advancing LLM methodologies, and conducting user studies. This research lays the foundation for more human-centered, ethical, and effective emotion analysis systems.},

abstract = {Worked examples, which illustrate the process for solving a problem step-by-step, are a well-established pedagogical technique that has been widely studied in computing classrooms. However, creating high-quality worked examples is very time-intensive for educators, and thus learners tend not to have access to a broad range of such examples. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), which appear capable of generating high-quality human-like content, may offer a solution. Separate strands of recent work have shown that LLMs can accurately generate code suitable for a novice audience, and that they can generate high-quality explanations of code. Therefore, LLMs may be well suited to creating a broad range of worked examples, overcoming the bottleneck of manual effort that is currently required. In this work, we present a novel tool, ‘WorkedGen’, which uses an LLM to generate interactive worked examples. We evaluate this tool with both an expert assessment of the content, and a user study involving students in a first-year Python programming course (n = ~400). We find that prompt chaining and one-shot learning are useful strategies for optimising the output of an LLM when producing worked examples. Our expert analysis suggests that LLMs generate clear explanations, and our classroom deployment revealed that students find the LLM-generated worked examples useful for their learning. We propose several avenues for future work, including investigating WorkedGen’s value in a range of programming languages, and with more complex questions suitable for more advanced courses.},

While prior efforts have focused on text, the potential of leveraging multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for online video studies remains underexplored. We conduct one of the first case studies on MLLM-assisted video content analysis, comparing AI’s interpretations to human understanding of abstract concepts. We leverage LLaVA-1.6 Mistral 7B to interpret four abstract concepts regarding video-mediated self-disclosure, analyzing 725 keyframes from 142 depression-related YouTube short videos. We perform a qualitative analysis of MLLM’s self-generated explanations and found that the degree of operationalization can influence MLLM’s interpretations. Interestingly, greater detail does not necessarily increase human-AI alignment. We also identify other factors affecting AI alignment with human understanding, such as concept complexity and versatility of video genres. Our exploratory study highlights the need to customize prompts for specific concepts and calls for researchers to incorporate more human-centered evaluations when working with AI systems in a multimodal context.},

We find that a naive application of in-context learning struggles on this problem, in particular with imperfect information. To address this, we introduce GameInterpreter, a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the comparative effectiveness of model-to-model transformations generated by an LLM based upon user prompts versus those created with dedicated model transformation languages, using a standard benchmark. The emergence of Generative AI offers a novel approach, allowing developers to specify transformations in natural language rather than learning specialized languages. However, our findings suggest that, in its current state, generative AI does not yet pose a threat to dedicated model transformation languages. While AI-assisted approaches promise to provide flexibility and accessibility, dedicated model transformation languages still offer structured advantages crucial for complex transformations, especially when bidirectionality and incrementality are mandatory requirements. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of AI in software engineering, highlighting its potential and current limitations in enhancing model transformation processes.},

abstract = {Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students’ use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course&nbsp;(n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools.},

abstract = {Background. Concurrent and parallel programming is difficult to teach and learn as the understanding of complex and abstract concepts such as nondeterminism, semaphore, and rare conditions, among others, is required [1, 2, 9], having as a core issue the synchronisation of processes to achieve a common goal [4]. It is well-acknowledged that concurrent and parallel programming skills are fundamental since, nowadays, computing is increasingly handled in a parallel manner [7].Problem and Motivation. Therefore, identifying students’ pitfalls and successes when solving practical concurrent and parallel programming exercises could shed light on the best approaches and strategies that they use [3]. In addition, the advent of large language models, and generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, has prompted intensive research on their use in several areas including programming teaching and learning [8]. Yet, the studies in the literature have focused on issues related to learning to program by novice students in introductory courses (e.g., CS1, CS2) [6]. Less work, however, has been presented on the impact of generative AI tools in advanced programming practices such as concurrent and parallel programming.Methodology. To investigate whether generative AI has had an impact on the submitted concurrent and parallel programming exercises solutions at the University of Aizu, Japan, we performed a comparison analysis of the students’ submissions over 2020–2023. The analysis included five different exercises covering the basis of concurrency through various tasks and scenarios where the implementation of parallel processes is needed as solution. For instance, exercises 2.3 and 2.4 required to create parallel processes and perform independent computations; exercises 3.2 and 3.3, required synchronisation of the parallel processes; and in exercise 3.5 a code template was given for modification. We analysed the submissions of 72 undergraduate 3rd year students (avg. 18 students/year) and labelled the solutions using the following nomenclature: OK, indicating a good solution; OKFeat, a good solution but with unusual features; AdvLib, use of unnecessary advanced library or functionality; BadTool, use of an inappropriate tool when the task definition explicitly required a different tool; CodeErr, general coding error; SyncErr, concurrent programming specific error; N/A, solution not submitted or incomplete.Results and Analysis. Results show a substantial increase in the incidence of use of advance libraries (AdvLib) and the wrong tools (BadTool) among students in 2023 for three out of the five analysed exercises. At the same time the concurrency programming-specific errors (SyncErr) also see a reduction in all the exercises. (Figure 1). This coincides with the availability of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT [5], which warrants further investigations to understand how students, teachers and instructors could harness the affordances of large language models in their concurrent programming learning, teaching, and practice.Contribution and Impact. This paper presents an initial step towards investigating the impact of generative AI on advanced programming topics. This research will continue to uncover strategies for the lecturers and instructors to identify the affordances and use of generative AI and to design exercises that harness these affordances to support students learning of difficult programming concepts.},

abstract = {Large language models are reshaping computing education. Based on recent research, these models explain code better than students, answer multiple choice questions at or above the class average, and generate code that can pass automated tests in introductory courses. In response to these capabilities, instructors have quickly adjusted their courses and assessment methods to align with shifting learning goals and the increased risk of academic integrity issues. While some scholars have advocated for the integration of visual problems as a safeguard against the capabilities of language models, new multimodal models now have vision and language capabilities that may allow them to analyze and solve visual problems. In this paper, we compare the large multimodal model (LMMs) GPT-4V with Bard, an LLM that uses Google Lens for text recognition. We find that LMMs, which have learned both pixel features (from images) and text features (from prompts) in the same embedding space, performed substantially better than Bard which uses a piecemeal approach. With a specific focus on Parsons problems presented across diverse visual representations, our results show that GPT-4V solved 96.7% these visual problems, struggling minimally with a single Parsons problem. Conversely, Bard performed poorly by only solving 69.2% of problems, struggling with common issues like hallucinations and refusals. These findings suggest that merely transitioning to visual programming problems might not be a panacea to issues of academic integrity in the generative AI era.},

abstract = {Point cloud upsampling is a critical task in 3D computer vision, aiming to generate dense and uniformly distributed point sets from sparse inputs. While current self-supervised methods show promise, they often struggle with preserving fine-grained geometric details, especially for highly sparse point clouds. To address these limitations, we propose PointUpsampleLLM (PULLM), a novel multimodal framework that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to enhance 3D point cloud upsampling. PULLM integrates a pretrained Point Cloud LLM (PointLLM) with visual features extracted from point clouds, learning a unified representation that captures both geometric and semantic information. At the core of our approach is the Feature Aware Translator (FAT) module, which effectively bridges the modality gap between visual and textual features, enhancing the spatial understanding of the LLM. PULLM generates textual descriptions of point clouds on-the-fly, eliminating the need for large paired datasets. Extensive experiments on the PU1K and PUGAN benchmarks demonstrate that PULLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance, Hausdorff Distance, and Point-to-Plane distance metrics. For instance, on the PUGAN dataset with sparse inputs, PULLM achieves a 56.15% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the best baseline. Our qualitative results further illustrate PULLM's superior ability to preserve fine details and generate high-quality upsampled point clouds across various object types and geometries.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in various natural language understanding and generation tasks. These pre-trained LLMs can be further improved for specific downstream tasks by fine-tuning. However, the adoption of LLM in real-world applications can be hindered by privacy concerns and the resource-intensive nature of model training and fine-tuning. When multiple entities have similar interested tasks but cannot directly share their local data due to privacy regulations, federated learning (FL) is a mainstream solution to leverage the data of different entities. Besides avoiding direct data sharing, FL can also achieve rigorous data privacy protection, model intelligent property protection, and model customization via composition with different techniques. Despite the aforementioned advantages of FL, fine-tuning LLMs in FL settings still lacks adequate support from the existing frameworks and, therefore, faces challenges in optimizing the consumption of significant communication and computational resources, preparing various data for different tasks, and satisfying diverse information protection demands. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and introduce our package FederatedScope-LLM (FS-LLM) as a main contribution, which consists: (1) We build a complete end-to-end benchmarking pipeline under real-world scenarios, automizing the processes of dataset preprocessing, federated fine-tuning execution or simulation, and performance evaluation; (2) We provide comprehensive and off-the-shelf federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithm implementations and versatile programming interfaces for future extension, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in FL scenarios with low communication and computation costs, even without accessing the full model; (3) We adopt several accelerating and resource-efficient operators, and provide flexible pluggable sub-routines for interdisciplinary study. We conduct extensive and reproducible experiments to show the effectiveness of FS-LLM and benchmark advanced LLMs with PEFT algorithms in FL. We release FS-LLM at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/llm.},

abstract = {Reasoning about code and explaining its purpose are fundamental skills for computer scientists. There has been extensive research in the field of computing education on the relationship between a student's ability to explain code and other skills such as writing and tracing code. In particular, the ability to describe at a high-level of abstraction how code will behave over all possible inputs correlates strongly with code writing skills. However, developing the expertise to comprehend and explain code accurately and succinctly is a challenge for many students. Existing pedagogical approaches that scaffold the ability to explain code, such as producing exemplar code explanations on demand, do not currently scale well to large classrooms. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) may offer a solution. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in generating explanations that can serve as examples to scaffold students' ability to understand and explain code. To evaluate LLM-created explanations, we compare them with explanations created by students in a large course (n ≈ 1000) with respect to accuracy, understandability and length. We find that LLM-created explanations, which can be produced automatically on demand, are rated as being significantly easier to understand and more accurate summaries of code than student-created explanations. We discuss the significance of this finding, and suggest how such models can be incorporated into introductory programming education.},

This new approach significantly enhances efficiency but also presents challenges in unsupervised code construction with limited security guarantees. LLMs excel in producing code with accurate grammar, yet they are not specifically trained to guarantee the security of the code. In this paper, we provide an initial exploration into using formal software specifications as a starting point for software construction, allowing developers to translate descriptions of security-related behavior into natural language instructions for LLMs, a.k.a., prompts. In addition, we leveraged automated verification tools to evaluate the code produced against the aforementioned specifications , following a modular, step-by-step software construction process. For our study, we leveraged Role-based Access Control (RBAC), a mature security model, and the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral specification language for Java. We test our approach on different publicly-available LLMs, namely, OpenAI ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and Microsoft CoPilot. We provide a description of two applications-a security-sensitive Banking application employing RBAC and an RBAC API module itself-, the corresponding JML specifications, as well as a description of the prompts, the generated code, the verification results, as well as a series of interesting insights for practitioners interested in further exploring the use of LLMs for securely constructing applications.},

abstract = {Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate patches for buggy programs. Traditional APR techniques suffer from a lack of patch variety as they rely heavily on handcrafted or mined bug fixing patterns and cannot easily generalize to other bug/fix types. To address this limitation, recent APR work has been focused on leveraging modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly generate patches for APR. Such LLM-based APR tools work by first constructing an input prompt built using the original buggy code and then querying the LLM to either fill-in (cloze-style APR) the correct code at the bug location or to produce a completely new code snippet as the patch. While the LLM-based APR tools are able to achieve state-of-the-art results, they still follow the classic Generate and Validate (GV) repair paradigm of first generating lots of patches by sampling from the same initial prompt and then validating each one afterwards. This not only leads to many repeated patches that are incorrect, but also misses the crucial and yet previously ignored information in test failures as well as in plausible patches.        To address these aforementioned limitations, we propose ChatRepair, the first fully automated conversation-driven APR approach that interleaves patch generation with instant feedback to perform APR in a conversational style. ChatRepair first feeds the LLM with relevant test failure information to start with, and then learns from both failures and successes of earlier patching attempts of the same bug for more powerful APR. For earlier patches that failed to pass all tests, we combine the incorrect patches with their corresponding relevant test failure information to construct a new prompt for the LLM to generate the next patch. In this way, we can avoid making the same    mistakes. For earlier patches that passed all the tests (i.e., plausible patches), we further ask the LLM to generate alternative variations of the original plausible patches. In this way, we can further build on and learn from earlier successes to generate more plausible patches to increase the chance of having correct patches. While our approach is general, we implement ChatRepair using state-of-the-art dialogue-based LLM – ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely studied Defects4j dataset shows that ChatRepair is able to achieve the new state-of-the-art in repair performance, achieving 114 and 48 correct fixes on Defects4j 1.2 and 2.0 respectively. By calculating the cost    of accessing ChatGPT, we can fix 162 out of 337 bugs for $0.42 each!},

abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3x higher throughput and consumes 2.3x less energy. CENT reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2x more tokens per dollar than GPUs.},

These results highlight the potential to develop AI assistants to dramatically lower the barrier to entry for working with hardware. To evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, we develop an automated testbench to quantify LLM performance on embedded programming tasks and perform 450 trials.

abstract = {Retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped traditional query-answering systems, offering unparalleled user experiences. However, existing retrieval techniques often struggle to handle multi-modal query contexts. In this paper, we present an interactive Multi-modal Query Answering (MQA) system, empowered by our newly developed multi-modal retrieval framework and navigation graph index, integrated with cutting-edge LLMs. It comprises five core components: Data Preprocessing, Vector Representation, Index Construction, Query Execution, and Answer Generation, all orchestrated by a dedicated coordinator to ensure smooth data flow from input to answer generation. One notable aspect of MQA is its utilization of contrastive learning to assess the significance of different modalities, facilitating precise measurement of multimodal information similarity. Furthermore, the system achieves efficient retrieval through our advanced navigation graph index, refined using computational pruning techniques. Another highlight of our system is its pluggable processing framework, allowing seamless integration of embedding models, graph indexes, and LLMs. This flexibility provides users diverse options for gaining insights from their multi-modal knowledge base. A preliminary video introduction of MQA is available at https://youtu.be/xvUuo2ZIqWk.},

abstract = {Critical thinking and creativity are fundamental skills for engineers and computer scientists. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) able to create chatbots that use natural language is an opportunity for educators to foster these skills. The well-known risk of generative AI for potential misinformation offers fertile ground to practice critical thinking.This paper describes a hands-on experience within a database course, where students had to develop a chatbot using the LangChain framework, and to evaluate it from different points of view. The students were free to choose the domain of their chatbot. The learning goal was twofold: on the one hand, to make them practice with state-of-the-art technologies, and on the other hand to stimulate critical analysis on their output. The paper discusses the students' evaluation of the chatbots under several metrics, including document retrieval, syntax and grammar accuracy, semantic relevance and information reliability. Students' assessments were also compared to the teachers' ones, to gain an insight on the critical attitude of the students and to offer a ground for discussion.The experience was stimulating and appreciated by the students. The final results highlight that the majority of students successfully produced chatbot responses that were grammatically and syntactically correct, and that consistently extracted pertinent sections from documents, yielding semantically relevant outputs. Despite these achievements, a significant portion of students expressed reservations about the reliability of the chatbot's responses to prompts, gaining awareness of LLMs' capability to generate responses that make sense to humans but may be potentially misleading.},

abstract = {In today’s educational landscape, students learn collaboratively, where students benefit from both peer interactions and facilitator guidance. Prior research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) has explored chatbots and AI techniques to aid such collaboration. However, these methods often depend on predefined dialogues (which limits adaptability), are not based on collaborative learning theories, and do not fully recognize the learning context. In this paper, we introduce an Large Language Model (LLM)-powered conversational AI, designed to enhance small group learning through its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. We detail the iterative design process, final design, and implementation. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the bot performs as designed but points to considerations in the timing of interventions and bot’s role in discussions. The evaluation also reveals that learners perceive the bot’s tone and behavior as important for engagement. We discuss design implications for chatbot integration in collaborative learning and future research directions.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) boasting billions of parameters have generated a significant demand for efficient deployment in inference workloads. While hardware accelerators for Transformer-based models have been extensively studied, the majority of existing approaches rely on temporal architectures that reuse hardware units for different network layers and operators. However, these methods often encounter challenges in achieving low latency due to considerable memory access overhead.This article investigates the feasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM inference on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Our approach involves the specialization of distinct hardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct communication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing off-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for estimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account the on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. This model can be extended to multi-FPGA settings for distributed inference. Through our analysis, we can identify the most effective parallelization and buffering schemes for the accelerator and, crucially, determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial acceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart.To enable more productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable. This library will be made available as open-source. To validate the effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT2) on an AMD Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 13.4\texttimes{} speedup when compared to previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative inference, we attain a 2.2\texttimes{} speedup compared to Design for Excellence, an FPGA overlay, in the prefill stage, while achieving a 1.9\texttimes{} speedup and a 5.7\texttimes{} improvement in energy efficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.},

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

Our proposed solution harnesses large language models (LLMs) to generate and execute Ansible playbooks automatically to address issues within these complex environments. Ansible playbooks, a widely adopted markup language for IT task automation, facilitate critical actions such as addressing network failures, resource constraints, configuration errors, and application bugs prevalent in managing microservices. We apply in-context learning on pre-trained LLMs using our custom-made Ansible-based remediation dataset, equipping these models to comprehend diverse remediation tasks within microservice environments. Then, these tuned LLMs efficiently generate precise Ansible scripts tailored to specific issues encountered, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques with high functional correctness (95.45%) and average correctness (98.86%).},

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to process text with human-like fluency and coherence, making them valuable for a wide range of data-related tasks fashioned as pipelines. The capabilities of LLMs in natural language understanding and generation, combined with their scalability, versatility, and state-of-the-art performance, enable innovative applications across various AI-related fields, including eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), and Knowledge Graphs (KG). Furthermore, we believe these models can extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions at scale, a practice commonly referred to as Big Data Analytics (BDA).

abstract = {Thematic analysis (TA) is a widely used qualitative method for identifying underlying meanings within unstructured text. However, TA requires manual processes, which become increasingly labour-intensive and time-consuming as datasets grow. While large language models (LLMs) have been introduced to assist with TA on small-scale datasets, three key limitations hinder their effectiveness. First, current approaches often depend on interactions between an LLM agent and a human coder, a process that becomes challenging with larger datasets. Second, with feedback from the human coder, the LLM tends to mirror the human coder, which provides a narrower viewpoint of the data. Third, existing methods follow a sequential process, where codes are generated for individual samples without recalling previous codes and associated data, reducing the ability to analyse data holistically. To address these limitations, we propose Thematic-LM, an LLM-based multi-agent system for large-scale computational thematic analysis. Thematic-LM assigns specialised tasks to each agent, such as coding, aggregating codes, and maintaining and updating the codebook. We assign coder agents different identity perspectives to simulate the subjective nature of TA, fostering a more diverse interpretation of the data. We applied Thematic-LM to the Dreaddit dataset and the Reddit climate change dataset to analyse themes related to social media stress and online opinions on climate change. We evaluate the resulting themes based on trustworthiness principles in qualitative research. Our study reveals insights such as assigning different identities to coder agents promotes divergence in codes and themes.},

abstract = {With the immense interest in ChatGPT worldwide, education has seen a mix of both excitement and skepticism. To properly evaluate its impact on education, it is crucial to understand how far it can help students without prior knowledge answer assessment questions. This study aims to address this question as well as the impact of the question type. We conducted multiple experiments with computer engineering students (experiment group: n=41 to 56), who were asked to use ChatGPT to answer previous test questions before learning about the related topics. Their scores were then compared with the scores of previous-term students who answered the same questions in a quiz or exam setting (control group: n=24 to 61). The results showed a wide range of effect sizes, from -2.55 to 1.23, depending on the question type and content. The experiment group performed best answering code analysis and conceptual questions but struggled with code completion and questions that involved images. However, the performance in code generation tasks was inconsistent. Overall, the ChatGPT group’s answers lagged slightly behind the control group’s answers with an effect size of -0.16. We conclude that ChatGPT, at least in the field of this study, is not yet ready to rely on by students who do not have sufficient background to evaluate generated answers. We suggest that educators try using ChatGPT and educate students on effective questioning techniques and how to assess the generated responses. This study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in code have shown exceptional proficiency across various programming-related tasks, particularly code generation. Nonetheless, due to its nature of pretraining on massive uncritically filtered data, prior studies have shown that code LLMs are prone to generate code with potential vulnerabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate this risk involve crafting data without vulnerability and subsequently retraining or fine-tuning the model. As the number of parameters exceeds a billion, the computation and data demands of the above approaches will be enormous. Moreover, an increasing number of code LLMs tend to be distributed as services, where the internal representation is not accessible, and the API is the only way to reach the LLM, making the prior mitigation strategies non-applicable.    To cope with this, we propose CoSec, an on-the-fly Security hardening method of code LLMs based on security model-guided Co-decoding, to reduce the likelihood of code LLMs to generate code containing vulnerabilities. Our key idea is to train a separate but much smaller security model to co-decode with a target code LLM. Since the trained secure model has higher confidence for secure tokens, it guides the generation of the target base model towards more secure code generation. By adjusting the probability distributions of tokens during each step of the decoding process, our approach effectively influences the tendencies of generation without accessing the internal parameters of the target code LLM. We have conducted extensive experiments across various parameters in multiple code LLMs (i.e., CodeGen, StarCoder, and DeepSeek-Coder), and the results show that our approach is effective in security hardening. Specifically, our approach improves the average security ratio of six base models by 5.02%-37.14%, while maintaining the functional correctness of the target model.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) enable state-of-the-art semantic capabilities to be added to software systems such as semantic search of unstructured documents and text generation. However, these models are computationally expensive. At scale, the cost of serving thousands of users increases massively affecting also user experience. To address this problem, semantic caches are used to check for answers to similar queries (that may have been phrased differently) without hitting the LLM service. Due to the nature of these semantic cache techniques that rely on query embeddings, there is a high chance of errors impacting user confidence in the system. Adopting semantic cache techniques usually requires testing the effectiveness of a semantic cache (accurate cache hits and misses) which requires a labelled test set of similar queries and responses which is often unavailable. In this paper, we present VaryGen, an approach for using LLMs for test input generation that produces similar questions from unstructured text documents. Our novel approach uses the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to 1) adapt queries to the domain, 2) synthesise subtle variations to queries, and 3) evaluate the synthesised test dataset. We evaluated our approach in the domain of a student question and answer system by qualitatively analysing 100 generated queries and result pairs, and conducting an empirical case study with an open source semantic cache. Our results show that query pairs satisfy human expectations of similarity and our generated data demonstrates failure cases of a semantic cache. Additionally, we also evaluate our approach on Qasper dataset. This work is an important first step into test input generation for semantic applications and presents considerations for practitioners when calibrating a semantic cache.},

This exploratory activity, which emphasizes collaboration and communication, provides step-by-step instructions for effectively interacting with ChatGPT during pair programming.This poster reflects on the advantages and limitations of using ChatGPT in pair programming. The main advantages of using ChatGPT include rapid responses, syntax error-free code generation, and flexibility in handling incomplete pseudocode. The primary limitations include the coding generation style, redundancy in responses, and challenges in understanding the code. Despite the advantages, it may still be valuable to have students work with human partners in certain situations, particularly for learning purposes.This poster proposes that ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for enhancing productivity and emphasizes the importance of becoming proficient in its use during students' college years.

abstract = {JavaScript interpreters, crucial for modern web browsers, require an effective fuzzing method to identify security-related bugs. However, the strict grammatical requirements for input present significant challenges. Recent efforts to integrate language models for context- aware mutation in fuzzing are promising but lack the necessary coverage guidance to be fully effective. This paper presents a novel technique called CovRL (Coverage-guided Reinforcement Learning) that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) from coverage feedback. Our fuzzer, CovRL-Fuzz, integrates coverage feedback directly into the LLM by leveraging the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method to construct a weighted coverage map. This map is key in calculating the fuzzing reward, which is then applied to the LLM-based mutator through reinforcement learning. CovRL-Fuzz, through this approach, enables the generation of test cases that are more likely to discover new coverage areas, thus improving bug detection while minimizing syntax and semantic errors, all without needing extra post-processing.

abstract = {Curating course material that aligns with students’ learning goals is a challenging and time-consuming task that instructors undergo when preparing their curricula. For instance, it is a challenge to find multiple-choice questions or example codes that demonstrate recursion in an unlabeled question bank or repository. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to generate high-quality learning materials at scale. In this poster, we use LLMs to identify programming concepts found within code snippets, allowing instructors to quickly curate their course materials. We compare programming concepts generated by LLMs with concepts generated by experts to see the extent to which they agree. The agreement was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa.},

abstract = {Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF data flow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53x~20.57\texttimes{} throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

abstract = {Recent advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence have driven significant progress in time series modeling and analysis. On one hand, researchers seek breakthroughs in performance on classical tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. On the other hand, it is intriguing to explore the potential for answering more complex inference and reasoning tasks from time series. In this keynote, I will examine the pathways toward foundation models for time series and discuss future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.The remarkable success of foundation models in natural language processing - exemplified by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) - suggests their potential to revolutionize time series analysis. I will introduce our recent efforts along this direction, including TEMPO, a novel framework designed to learn effective time series representations by leveraging two key inductive biases: one is explicit decomposition of trend, seasonal, and residual components, and the second is prompt-based distribution adaptation for diverse time series types.Beyond representation learning, practical applications demands advanced reasoning capabilities with multi-step time series inference task, requiring both compositional reasoning and computational precision. To tackle this challenge, I will discuss TS-reasoner, a program-aided inference agent that integrates large language models (LLMs) with structured execution pipelines, in-context learning, and self-correction mechanisms. I will discuss a new benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically assess multi-step time series reasoning.By bridging deep learning advances with structured reasoning, I will highlight the next frontier in time series research, i.e., developing foundation models that enhance forecasting performance, generative models, and reasoning capabilities from time series across diverse applications.},

abstract = {Machine learning-based methods have shown promising results in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) like logic synthesis result prediction, enabling a shift-left in the overall EDA flow. Designers should fully optimize their Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs early because remedying low-quality RTL in downstream synthesis stages is extremely challenging. However, previous works mainly start modeling from the netlist level or layout level and apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to make predictions.RTL captures the logic and scale information of circuits with uniform representation, making it suitable for a unified embedding approach. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) possess the ability to understand text modality, making them a potential method for understanding RTL and performing various EDA tasks. Therefore, we propose LLSM, the first LLM-enhanced logic synthesis model to extract information directly from RTL code. We also propose three novel approaches for LLSM in this paper. (1) EDA-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We apply LLMs guided by circuit knowledge to summarize, analyze RTL code, and generate text with circuit information. (2) Text-circuit hybrid embedding. We train a small Language Model (LM) to encode the generated circuit information from LLM and fuse the embeddings of text and circuit modalities with weighted summation. (3) AIG-tailored acceleration library. We utilize an ELL2 format with zero padding tailored for And-Inverter-Graph (AIG) circuit representation and fuse the computation and format conversion. We also design a cacheable state strategy to avoid redundant computation for LM. We are the first to work with both LLM and GNN for the prediction of logic synthesis results and conduct extensive experiments on the OpenABC-D dataset. LLSM achieve up to 21.53% and 19.27% loss reduction in delay and area prediction respectively. It also achieves 1.34\texttimes{} and 6296.77\texttimes{} speedup on average compared to PyG implementation and Synopsis Design Compiler, respectively.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges due to hallucination issues. Current solutions use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrating LLMs with external knowledge to enhance answer accuracy. However, the misuse of irrelevant external knowledge can be misleading. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Retrieve-and-Discriminate Prompter (RD-P), which leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) for trustworthy RAG by synchronizing knowledge retrieval and discrimination in a unified model. Specifically, we train a prompter based on a pre-trained language model with shared parameters. It has two key modules: the retriever and the discriminator. The retriever identifies relevant reasoning paths in the KG, while the discriminator evaluates their credibility through "logical coverage calculation" and in turn instructs the retrieval process. Prompts are then constructed to guide LLMs in reasoning and answering questions using both retrieved and implicit knowledge. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering (QA) tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves answer coverage rate while reducing the retrieval scale, achieving superior performance in complex KGQA tasks compared with state-of-the-art RAG methods at a low cost.},

abstract = {Programming has been considered the "essence of informatics" since the beginning of computing as a discipline. But programming in the fifties was very different from what we know today, and one of the goals (or dreams) throughout the history of programming language technology, has been "automatic programming''---the ability to automatically generate computer code starting from a high(er)-level description of the specification of that code. What this meant changed over the years, from punching paper tape, to compiling high-level programming languages, to program synthesis.Today, however, the availability of machine learning artefacts that produce high-level code from natural language specifications has completely changed the traditional meaning. To the extent that some computer scientists have begun to question the received wisdom that the core of their discipline is deeply rooted in programming.If programming and programming languages are no longer the essence of computer science, this changes the epistemology of the discipline itself. Moreover, if we are at the end of programming, we should also change the curriculum, where programming, algorithms and programming languages play a major role. Several recent papers reviewed the performance of code generators based on large language models on typical CS1 problems (e.g., from the many possible citations and how machine learning impacts K-12 teaching.Starting from this data, I will argue for the role of programming in the curriculum, distinguishing between programming taught as part of a holistic curriculum (as in some non-technical high schools) or as a vocational tool. I will use Simondon's notion of (closed and open) technical object as an interpretive lens, together with Calvino's reflections on the availability of writing machines capable of replacing the poet and the author.},

We are witnessing a blossom of LLMs for various fields, especially in multi-modal data research such as vision-language learning, where text modality serves as a supplement for images. As textual modality has rarely been introduced into modality combinations in urban region profiling, we aim to answer two fundamental questions: i) Can text modality enhance urban region profiling? ii) and if so, in what ways and which aspects? To answer the questions, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduce the first-ever LLM-enhanced framework that integrates the knowledge of text modality into urban imagery, named LLM-enhanced Urban Region Profiling with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (UrbanCLIP ). Specifically, it first generates a detailed textual description for each satellite image by Image-to-Text LLMs. Then, the model is trained on image-text pairs, seamlessly unifying language supervision for urban visual representation learning, jointly with contrastive loss and language modeling loss. Results on urban indicator prediction in four major metropolises show its superior performance, with an average improvement of 6.1% on R2 compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students’ usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.},

abstract = {Vectorization is a powerful optimization technique that significantly boosts the performance of high performance computing applications operating on large data arrays. Despite decades of research on auto-vectorization, compilers frequently miss opportunities to vectorize code. On the other hand, writing vectorized code manually using compiler intrinsics is still a complex, error-prone task that demands deep knowledge of specific architecture and compilers.  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of large-language models (LLMs) to generate vectorized (Single Instruction Multiple Data) code from scalar programs that process individual array elements.   We propose a novel finite-state-machine multi-agents based approach that harnesses LLMs and test-based feedback to generate vectorized code.  Our findings indicate that LLMs are capable of producing high-performance vectorized code with run-time speedup ranging from 1.1x to 9.4x as compared to the state-of-the-art compilers such as Intel Compiler, GCC, and Clang.  To verify the correctness of vectorized code, we use Alive2, a leading bounded translation validation tool for LLVM IR. We describe a few domain-specific techniques to improve the scalability of Alive2 on our benchmark dataset. Overall, our approach is able to verify 38.2% of vectorizations as correct on the TSVC benchmark dataset.},

Researchers have shown that generative AI tools are capable of solving programming problems, writing extensive blocks of code, and explaining complex code in simple terms. Particular promise has been shown in using generative AI to enhance programming error messages. Both students and instructors have complained for decades that these messages are often cryptic and difficult to understand. Yet recent work has shown that students make fewer repeated errors when enhanced via GPT-4. We extend this work by implementing feedback from ChatGPT for all programs submitted to our automated assessment tool, Athene, providing help for compiler, run-time, and logic errors. Our results indicate that adding generative AI to an automated assessment tool does not necessarily make it better and that design of the interface matters greatly to the usability of the feedback that GPT-4 provided.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models’ performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training. Interestingly, even when Large Language Models like CodeLlama and StarCoder2 are used for code generation, the Pass@K ( (K=1,5,10) ) results lags signigicantly behind Python scores. Our research shows that R as a low resource language requires different techniques to collect a high quality data. Specifically separating the two R styles has a great impact on the results and the separate dataset could increase the performance of the models. Our research sheds light on the capabilities of Code-PLMs and opens new research directions for researchers and practitioners for developing code intelligence tools and techniques for R. With R's widespread use and popularity, the results of our study can potentially benefit a large community of R developers, both in research and industry.},

abstract = {This paper explores how Generative AI can be incorporated into software development education. We present examples of formative and summative assessments, which explore various aspects of ChatGPT, including its coding capabilities, its ability to construct arguments as well as ethical issues of using ChatGPT and similar tools in education and the workplace. Our work is inspired by the insights from surveys that show that the learners on our Degree Apprenticeship Programme have a great interest in learning about and exploiting emerging AI technology. Similarly, our industrial partners have a clear interest for their employees to be formally prepared to use GenAI in their software engineering roles. In this vein, it is proposed that embedding the use of GenAI tools in a careful and creative way - by developing assessments which encourage learners to critically evaluate AI output - can be beneficial in helping learners understand the subject material being taught without the risk of the AI tools “doing the homework”.},

abstract = {In the contemporary business landscape, organizations often rely on third-party services for many functions, including IT services, cloud computing, and business processes. To identify potential security risks, organizations conduct rigorous assessments before engaging with third-party vendors, referred to as Third-Party Security Risk Management (TPSRM). Traditionally, TPSRM assessments are executed manually by human experts and involve scrutinizing various third-party documents such as System and Organization Controls Type 2 (SOC 2) reports and reviewing comprehensive questionnaires along with the security policy and procedures of vendors—a process that is time-intensive and inherently lacks scalability. 
 
 
 
AgraBOT, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, can assist TPSRM assessors by expediting TPSRM assessments and reducing the time required from days to mere minutes. AgraBOT utilizes cutting-edge AI techniques, including information retrieval (IR), large language models (LLMs), multi-stage ranking, prompt engineering, and in-context learning to accurately generate relevant answers from third-party documents to conduct assessments. We evaluate AgraBOT on seven real TPSRM assessments, consisting of 373 question-answer pairs, and attain an F1 score of 0.85.},

abstract = {We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

abstract = {Edugator is a browser-based, AI-enabled tool designed to help instructors of introductory computing courses create and deliver interactive educational content. It streamlines the content authoring process by incorporating generative AI models into both the creation and delivery stages. Instructors can create bespoke interactive computing lessons and programming problems by providing a prompt and a few clicks. They can also author templates and test cases in programming languages such as C++, Java, C, and Python. Additionally, instructors can validate programming problems by running them against an auto-generated solution, allowing them to refine the problems before releasing it to students, preventing misinformation or ambiguity. Students can complete lessons and solve programming problems in a browser-based text editor receiving immediate feedback. They can also interact with a large language model-powered AI chatbot that scaffolds a student on how to approach the problem without giving out solutions. Edugator is built using modern web frameworks and the goal of the tool is to accelerate the adoption of automated assessment tools by minimizing the challenges instructors face with such tools. It also supports Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), allowing seamless integration with learning management systems (LMS). The demo will provide an overview of Edugator's features, including authoring programming problems and lessons using AI or remixing existing problems obtained from test banks, LTI integration, and AI-chatbot.

However, the release of ChatGPT and other free-to-use generative AI tools has provided a new and distinct method for cheating. Students can run many assessment questions through the tool and generate a superficially compelling answer, which may or may not be accurate.&nbsp;We ran a dual-anonymous “quality assurance” marking exercise across four end-of-module assessments across a distance university computer science (CS) curriculum. Each marker received five ChatGPT-generated scripts alongside 10 student scripts. A total of 90 scripts were marked; every ChatGPT-generated script for the undergraduate modules received at least a passing grade (&gt;40%), with all of the introductory module CS1 scripts receiving a distinction (&gt;85%). None of the ChatGPT-taught postgraduate scripts received a passing grade (&gt;50%). We also present the results of interviewing the markers and of running our sample scripts through a GPT-2 detector and the TurnItIn AI detector, which both identified every ChatGPT-generated script but differed in the number of false positives. As such, we contribute a baseline understanding of how the public release of generative AI is likely to significantly impact quality assurance processes. Our analysis demonstrates that in most cases, across a range of question formats, topics, and study levels, ChatGPT is at least capable of producing adequate answers for undergraduate assessment.},

This paper suggests that using a combination of LLMs to seed population-based algorithms introduces more variation and leads to a wider variety of problems that can be solved, due to leveraging the strengths of component LLMs. We test this on the PSB2 suite, using the Search, Execute, Instruct, Debug and Rank (SEIDR) algorithm. In all cases examined, we find that using a combination of LLMs leads to more problems solved and better test pass rates compared to using the best individual model. We also find that the computational cost, as measured in terms of excess programs generated, is lowered.},

This study introduces the “Focus Agent,” a Large Language Model (LLM) powered framework that simulates both the focus group (for data collection) and acts as a moderator in a focus group setting with human participants. To assess the data quality derived from the Focus Agent, we ran five focus group sessions with a total of 23 human participants as well as deploying the Focus Agent to simulate these discussions with AI participants. Quantitative analysis indicates that Focus Agent can generate opinions similar to those of human participants. Furthermore, the research exposes some improvements associated with LLMs acting as moderators in focus group discussions that include human participants.},

abstract = {The recent public releases of AI tools such as ChatGPT have forced computer science educators to reconsider how they teach. These tools have demonstrated considerable ability to generate code and answer conceptual questions, rendering them incredibly useful for completing CS coursework. While overreliance on AI tools could hinder students’ learning, we believe they have the potential to be a helpful resource for both students and instructors alike. We propose a novel system for instructor-mediated GPT interaction in a class discussion board. By automatically generating draft responses to student forum posts, GPT can help Teaching Assistants (TAs) respond to student questions in a more timely manner, giving students an avenue to receive fast, quality feedback on their solutions without turning to ChatGPT directly. Additionally, since they are involved in the process, instructors can ensure that the information students receive is accurate, and can provide students with incremental hints that encourage them to engage critically with the material, rather than just copying an AI-generated snippet of code. We utilize Piazza—a popular educational forum where TAs help students via text exchanges—as a venue for GPT-assisted TA responses to student questions. These student questions are sent to GPT-4 alongside assignment instructions and a customizable prompt, both of which are stored in editable instructor-only Piazza posts. We demonstrate an initial implementation of this system, and provide examples of student questions that highlight its benefits.},

abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models(LLM) and generative AI has led to an explosive increase in computational demands across cloud computing data centers. The growing number of parameters in deep learning models results in significant power consumption problem, leading to the need for cost-effective and eco-friendly data centers. Furthermore, with the advent of multi-cloud environments, deep learning computations, not only for training but also for inference, no longer occur on a single hardware unit but are distributed across various heterogeneous hardware nodes forming clusters. In this paper, we present solutions to these challenges from a parallelism perspective. Considering the characteristics of the models, we implement data parallelism and model parallelism, partitioning models and data across heterogeneous hardware nodes for power-efficient learning and inferencing. To quantify the impact, we measured the power consumption of CPUs, GPUs, and RAM during the experiments, providing insights into the energy efficiency of the proposed partitioning strategies. Furthermore, we conducted a carbon footprint analysis, converting the measured power consumption into equivalent carbon emissions. The study highlights the necessity of partitioning research for energy-efficient learning and inferencing, addressing the identified issues.},

abstract = {Query performance prediction (QPP) aims to estimate the retrieval quality of a search system for a query without human relevance judgments. Previous QPP methods typically return a single scalar value and do not require the predicted values to approximate a specific information retrieval (IR) evaluation measure, leading to certain drawbacks: (i) a single scalar is insufficient to accurately represent different IR evaluation measures, especially when metrics do not highly correlate, and (ii) a single scalar limits the interpretability of QPP methods because solely using a scalar is insufficient to explain QPP results. To address these issues, we propose a QPP framework using automatically generated relevance judgments (QPP-GenRE), which decomposes QPP into independent subtasks of predicting the relevance of each item in a ranked list to a given query. This allows us to predict any IR evaluation measure using the generated relevance judgments as pseudo-labels. This also allows us to interpret predicted IR evaluation measures, and identify, track and rectify errors in generated relevance judgments to improve QPP quality. We predict an item’s relevance by using open-source large language models (LLMs) to ensure scientific reproducibility.We face two main challenges: (i) excessive computational costs of judging an entire corpus for predicting a metric considering recall, and (ii) limited performance in prompting open-source LLMs in a zero-/few-shot manner. To solve the challenges, we devise an approximation strategy to predict an IR measure considering recall and propose to fine-tune open-source LLMs using human-labeled relevance judgments. Experiments on the TREC 2019–2022 deep learning tracks and CAsT-19–20 datasets show that QPP-GenRE achieves state-of-the-art QPP quality for both lexical and neural rankers.},

abstract = {AI/ML techniques have been used to solve systems problems, but their applicability to customize solutions on-the-fly has been limited. Traditionally, any customization required manually changing the AI/ML model or modifying the code, configuration parameters, application settings, etc. This incurs too much time and effort, and is very painful. In this paper, we propose a novel technique using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology, wherein instructions can be provided in natural language and actual code to handle any customization is automatically generated, integrated and applied on-the-fly. Such capability is extremely powerful since it makes customization of application settings or solution techniques super easy. Specifically, we propose ECO-LLM (LLM-based Edge Cloud Optimization), which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically adjust placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers, in response to changes in application workload, such that insights are delivered quickly with low cost of operation (systems problem). Our experiments with real-world video analytics applications i.e. face recognition, human attributes detection and license plate recognition show that ECO-LLM is able to automatically generate code on-the-fly and adapt placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers. We note that the trigger workload (to switch between edge and cloud) for ECO-LLM is exactly the same as the baseline (manual) and actual placement performed by ECO-LLM is only slightly different i.e. on average (across 2 days) only 1.45% difference in human attributes detection and face recognition, and 1.11% difference in license plate recognition. Although we tackle this specific systems problem in this paper, our proposed GenAI-based technique is applicable to solve other systems problems too.},

abstract = {Analog circuit design requires substantial human expertise and involvement, which is a significant roadblock to design productivity. Bayesian Optimization (BO), a popular machine-learning-based optimization strategy, has been leveraged to automate analog design given its applicability across various circuit topologies and technologies. Traditional BO methods employ black-box Gaussian Process surrogate models and optimized labeled data queries to find optimization solutions by trading off between exploration and exploitation. However, the search for the optimal design solution in BO can be expensive from both a computational and data usage point of view, particularly for high-dimensional optimization problems. This paper presents ADO-LLM, the first work integrating large language models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization for analog design optimization. ADO-LLM leverages the LLM's ability to infuse domain knowledge to rapidly generate viable design points to remedy BO's inefficiency in finding high-value design areas specifically under the limited design space coverage of the BO's probabilistic surrogate model. In the meantime, sampling of design points evaluated in the iterative BO process provides quality demonstrations for the LLM to generate high-quality design points while leveraging infused broad design knowledge. Furthermore, the diversity brought by BO's exploration enriches the contextual understanding of the LLM and allows it to more broadly search in the design space and prevent repetitive and redundant suggestions. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different types of analog circuits and demonstrate notable improvements in design efficiency and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is positively grasped as promising to disrupt the higher education system but it also poses a number of challenges. Although so many studies attempt to explore the matching of the possibility of this growing technology with the higher education system, ample research needs to be conducted to solve the challenges facing the renovation of higher education. With this in mind, our aim of bibliometric studies is to conduct a deep investigation into the increasingly developing scenario of Generative AI tools in higher education. We extracted data from the Web of Science database that is up-to-date till July 2024, comprising 934 relevant articles. Co-citation and co-word analyses revealed three main research clusters: advanced computationable methods, AI application in higher education, and user technology and adoption. The findings illustrated rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies with prominent emphasis on large-language models in pedagogical practices. Other critical themes center around developing AI-facilitated learning interventions, ethical challenges, and usage impact on learning outcomes. The results show that the field is inherently interdisciplinary, using ideas from educational technology, cognitive science, and AI. In addition, a rising trend is noted for the focus on academic honesty and users' involvement with AI devices. The results indicate the important implications of this study for teachers and policymakers alongside contributions to teaching and research that offer a guide to sustainable improvement across education. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to realize the long-term implications and address complex issues surrounding the integration of AI within universities.},

abstract = {As health-related decision-making evolves, patients increasingly seek help from additional online resources such as "Dr. Google" and ChatGPT. Despite their potential, these tools encounter limitations, including the risk of potentially inaccurate information, a lack of specialized medical knowledge, the risk of generating unrealistic outputs (hallucinations), and significant computational demands. In this study, we develop and validate an innovative shared decisionmaking (SDM) tool, Chat-Orthopedist, for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients and families to prepare a meaningful discussion with clinicians based on retrieval-augmented large language models. Firstly, we establish an external knowledge base with information on AIS disease and treatment options Secondly, we develop a retrieval-augmented ChatGPT to feed LLMs with AIS domain knowledge, providing accurate and comprehensible responses to patient inquiries. In addition, we perform a cyclical process of human-in-the-loop evaluations for system validation and improvement. ment. Chat-Orthopedist may optimize SDM workflow by enabling better interactive learning experiences, more effective clinical visits, and better-informed treatment decision-making.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) show amazing performance on many domain-specific tasks after fine-tuning with some appropriate data. However, many domain-specific data are privately distributed across multiple owners. Thus, this dilemma raises the interest in how to perform LLM fine-tuning in federated learning (FL). However, confronted with limited computation and communication capacities, FL clients struggle to fine-tune an LLM effectively. To this end, we introduce FedBiOT, a resource-efficient LLM fine-tuning approach to FL. Specifically, our method involves the server generating a compressed LLM and aligning its performance with the full model. Subsequently, the clients fine-tune a lightweight yet important part of the compressed model, referred to as an adapter. Notice that as the server has no access to the private data owned by the clients, the data used for alignment by the server has a different distribution from the one used for fine-tuning by clients. We formulate the problem into a bi-level optimization problem to minimize the negative effect of data discrepancy and derive the updating rules for the server and clients. We conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-2, empirically showing that the adapter has exceptional performance when reintegrated into the global LLM. The results also indicate that the proposed FedBiOT significantly reduces resource consumption compared to existing benchmarks, all while achieving comparable performance levels.},

The black test approach adopted by online judge systems can only outputs either an answer is correct or incorrect. This study proposes a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to automatically grade answers from students for programming assignments. A LLM mode formed by coder-decoder architecture is utilized to generate summarization from source code, then the summarization is compared to the textual assignment description by semantic similarity. Finally, the output is converted to five-score rating. CodeBERT and a Transformer model serve as coder and decoder respectively. The semantic similarity is computed by MiniLM-L6.

Despite the recent success, the current development of voice LLMs in low-resource applications is hampered by data scarcity and high computational cost. In this work, we propose VoiceTuner, with a self-supervised pre-training and efficient fine-tuning approach for low-resource voice generation. Specifically, 1) to mitigate data scarcity, we leverage large-scale unlabeled dataset and pre-train VoiceTuner-SSL without pre-defined applications, which can be fine-tuned in downstream tasks; 2) to further reduce the high training cost in complete fine-tuning, we introduce a multiscale transformer adapter to effectively update only around 1% parameters as a plug-and-play module. Experimental results demonstrate that VoiceTuner-SSL presents strong acoustic continuations, and VoiceTuner achieves state-of-the-art results in rich-resource TTS evaluation compared with competitive baseline models. Low-resource (1h, 10h, 30h) downstream applications including zero-shot TTS, instruction TTS, and singing voice synthesis present VoiceTuner's superior audio quality and style similarity with reduced data requirement and computational cost.

Specifically, in ALTER, we propose the Mixture-of-Task-Adapters (MTA) module as an extension to the transformer architecture for the underlying model to capture the intra-task and inter-task knowledge. A two-stage training method is further proposed to optimize the collaboration between adapters at a small computational cost. Experimental results over a mixture of NLP tasks show that our proposed MTA architecture and the two-stage training method achieve good performance. Based on ALTER, we have also produced MTA-equipped language models for various domains.},

Code2API does not require additional model training or any manual crafting rules and can be easily deployed on personal computers without relying on other external tools. Specifically, Code2API guides the LLMs through well-designed prompts to generate well-formed APIs for given code snippets. To elicit knowledge and logical reasoning from LLMs, we used chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and few-shot in-context learning, which can help the LLMs fully understand the APIzation task and solve it step by step in a manner similar to a developer. Our evaluations show that Code2API achieves a remarkable accuracy in identifying method parameters (65%) and return statements (66%) equivalent to human-generated ones, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approach, APIzator, by 15.0% and 16.5% respectively. Moreover, compared with APIzator, our user study demonstrates that Code2API exhibits superior performance in generating meaningful method names, even surpassing the human-level performance, and developers are more willing to use APIs generated by our approach, highlighting the applicability of our tool in practice. Finally, we successfully extend our framework to the Python dataset, achieving a comparable performance with Java, which verifies the generalizability of our tool.},

Recently, tools that leverage LLMs have made their way into the classroom where they help students generate code and help instructors generate learning materials. There are likely many more uses of these tools -- both beneficial to learning and possibly detrimental to learning. To help ensure that these tools are used to enhance learning, educators need to not only be familiar with these tools, but with their use and potential misuse. The goal of this BoF is to raise awareness about LLMs and to build a learning community around their use in computing education. Aligned with this goal of building an inclusive learning community, our BoF is led by globally distributed discussion leaders, including undergraduate researchers, to facilitate multiple coordinated discussions that can lead to a broader conversation about the role of LLMs in CS education.},

abstract = {Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences over the software supply chain. In the literature, fuzzing has been extensively studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates test programs without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. As such, they often fail to construct test programs to exercise intricate optimizations. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, such as symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compiler systems. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks and even have achieved state-of-the-art performance in black-box fuzzing. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the emerging deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: (i) an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; (ii) an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are also used as feedback to further enhance the test generation prompt on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows that WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations requiring intricate conditions, practicing up to 8 times more optimizations than state-of-the-art fuzzers. To date, WhiteFox has found in total 101 bugs for the compilers under test, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 already fixed. Notably, WhiteFox has been recently acknowledged by the PyTorch team, and is in the process of being incorporated into its development workflow. Finally, beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains, such as LLVM, where WhiteFox has already found multiple bugs.},

abstract = {Bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries may affect almost all downstream DL applications, and it is crucial to ensure the quality of such systems. It is challenging to generate valid input programs for fuzzing DL libraries, since the input programs need to satisfy both the syntax/semantics of the supported languages (e.g., Python) and the tensor/operator constraints for constructing valid computational graphs. Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the language and DL computation constraints to generate valid programs for fuzzing DL libraries (and beyond). However, LLMs tend to generate ordinary programs following similar patterns/tokens with typical programs seen in their massive pre-training corpora (e.g., GitHub), while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or are unlikely to be manually produced.To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first approach to priming LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is mainly built on the well-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include rare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Meanwhile, while traditional techniques leveraging such historical information require intensive human efforts to both design dedicated generators and ensure the syntactic/semantic validity of generated programs, FuzzGPT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs (including fine-tuning and in-context learning), while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While FuzzGPT can be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: Codex and CodeGen. Moreover, FuzzGPT also shows the potential of directly leveraging the instruction-following capability of the recent ChatGPT for effective fuzzing. The experimental study on two popular DL libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow) shows that FuzzGPT can substantially outperform TitanFuzz, detecting 76 bugs, with 49 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs, including 11 high-priority bugs or security vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called  (counterparts) ) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. The first challenge is addressed by an observation that DL libraries are commonly designed to support the computation of a similar set of DL algorithms. Therefore, the counterpart of a given API’s computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. DLLens incorporates a novel counterpart synthesis workflow, leveraging a large language model (LLM) to search for valid counterparts for differential testing. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM’s knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. DLLens incorporates validation mechanisms to manage the LLM’s hallucinations in counterpart synthesis and path constraint extraction.We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.},

abstract = {The challenges posed by the Dark Silicon era, combined with the escalating computational demands of emerging applications, such as Deep Learning (DL), have strained the capabilities of traditional CPUs and GPUs, necessitating the development of Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSAs). Despite offering substantial enhancements in Power, Performance, and Area (PPA), DSAs encounter significant challenges, including the rapid evolution of applications that necessitate the frequent development of new architectures. This, coupled with the expertise-intensive nature of the design process, often leads to reduced flexibility and extended development cycles, ultimately hindering the broader adoption and efficient deployment of DSAs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM-AID, an agile framework that streamlines the DSA design flow by transforming high-level abstract specifications into Hardware Description Language (HDL) code and facilitating backend Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool operations. By synergistically combining Large Language Models (LLMs), High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, design exploration techniques, and symbolic AI, LLM-AID dramatically accelerates design iterations, optimizes hardware performance, and significantly reduces time-to-market. This innovative approach democratizes DSA development, empowering designers to achieve unprecedented productivity while delivering high-quality DSA solutions.},

abstract = {With the rise of large language models (LLMs), recent works have leveraged LLMs to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors. As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items. To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database. Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings. This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity. Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores. Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences. BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.},

abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

The first task of this paper is to explore optimization strategies to expedite LLMs, including quantization, pruning, and operation-level optimizations. One unique direction is to optimize LLM inference through novel software/hardware co-design methods. Given the accelerated LLMs, the second task of this paper is to study LLMs' performance in the usage scenario of circuit design and verification. Specifically, we place a particular emphasis on functional verification. Through automated prompt engineering, we harness the capabilities of the established LLM, GPT-4, to generate High-Level Synthesis (HLS) designs with predefined errors based on 11 open-source synthesizable HLS benchmark suites. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of over 1000 function-level designs, and each of which is afflicted with up to 45 distinct combinations of defects injected into the source code. This dataset, named Chrysalis, expands upon what's available in current HLS error models, offering a rich resource for training to improve how LLMs debug code.

abstract = {Training deep learning models, particularly Transformer-based architectures such as Large Language Models (LLMs), demands substantial computational resources and extended training periods. While optimal configuration and infrastructure selection can significantly reduce associated costs, this optimization requires preliminary analysis tools. This paper introduces PreNeT, a novel predictive framework designed to address this optimization challenge. PreNeT facilitates training optimization by integrating comprehensive computational metrics, including layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations and memory utilization. A key feature of PreNeT is its capacity to accurately predict training duration on previously unexamined hardware infrastructures, including novel accelerator architectures. This framework employs a sophisticated approach to capture and analyze the distinct characteristics of various neural network layers, thereby enhancing existing prediction methodologies. Through proactive implementation of PreNeT, researchers and practitioners can determine optimal configurations, parameter settings, and hardware specifications to maximize cost-efficiency and minimize training duration. Experimental results demonstrate that PreNeT achieves up to 72% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks.},

abstract = {As the demand for more personalized recommendation grows and a dramatic boom in commercial scenarios arises, the study on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted much attention, which uses the data from all scenarios to simultaneously improve their recommendation performance. However, existing methods tend to integrate insufficient scenario knowledge and neglect learning personalized cross-scenario preferences, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile, though large language model (LLM) has shown great capability of reasoning and capturing semantic information, the high inference latency and high computation cost of tuning hinder its implementation in industrial recommender systems. To fill these gaps, we propose an LLM-enhanced paradigm LLM4MSR in this work. Specifically, we first leverage LLM to uncover multi-level knowledge from the designed scenario- and user-level prompt without fine-tuning the LLM, then adopt hierarchical meta networks to generate multi-level meta layers to explicitly improve the scenario-aware and personalized recommendation capability. Our experiments on KuaiSAR-small, KuaiSAR, and Amazon datasets validate significant advantages of LLM4MSR: (i) the effectiveness and compatibility with different multi-scenario backbone models, (ii) high efficiency and deployability on industrial recommender systems, and (iii) improved interpretability. The implemented code and data is available to ease reproduction.},

abstract = {Handling long tail corner cases is a major challenge faced by autonomous vehicles (AVs). While large language models (LLMs) hold great potentials to handle the corner cases with excellent generalization and explanation capabilities and received increasing research interest on application to autonomous driving, there are still technical barriers to be tackled, such as strict model performance and huge computing resource requirements of LLMs, which are difficult to be met locally at AVs. In this paper, we investigate a new approach of applying remote or edge LLMs to support autonomous driving. With this approach connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) send driving assistance requests to the LLMs. LLMs deployed at the edge of the networks or remote clouds process the requests and generate driving assistance instructions for the CAVs. A key issue for such LLM assisted driving system is the assessment of LLMs on their understanding of driving theory and skills, ensuring they are qualified to undertake safety critical driving assistance tasks for CAVs. As there is no published work on assessing LLM of driving theory and skills, we design and run driving theory tests for several proprietary LLM models (OpenAI GPT models, Baidu Ernie and Ali QWen) and open-source LLM models (Tsinghua MiniCPM-2B and MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5) with more than 500 multiple-choices theory test questions. These questions are close to the official UK driving theory test ones. Model accuracy, cost and processing latency are measured from the experiments. Experiment results show that while model GPT-4 passes the test with improved domain knowledge and Ernie has an accuracy of 85% (just below the 86% passing threshold), other LLM models including GPT-3.5 fail the test. For the test questions with images, the multimodal model GPT4-o has an excellent accuracy result of 96%, and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5 achieves an accuracy of 76%. While GPT-4 holds stronger potential for CAV driving assistance applications, the cost of using model GPT4 is much higher, almost 50 times of that of using GPT3.5. The results can help make decision on the use of the existing LLMs for CAV applications and balancing on the model performance and cost.},

abstract = {Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models. However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces. Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our EEG encoder achieves up to 55.15% top-20 classification accuracy with visualization results validating its ability to learn from unspoken EEG recordings. Subsequently, using the predicted classification results, our retrieval method attains a recall@5 of up to 55.55% for sentence-level evaluation. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are remarked by their substantial computational requirements. To mitigate the cost, researchers develop specialized CUDA kernels, which often fuse several tensor operations to maximize the utilization of GPUs as much as possible. However, those specialized kernels may still leave performance on the table as CUDA assembly experts show that manual optimization of GPU SASS schedules can lead to better performance, and trial-and-error is largely employed to manually find the best GPU SASS schedules.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this work, we employ an automatic approach to optimize GPU SASS schedules, which thus can be integrated into existing compiler frameworks. The key to automatic optimization is training an RL agent to mimic how human experts perform manual scheduling. To this end, we formulate an assembly game, where RL agents can play to find the best GPU SASS schedules. The assembly game starts from a -O3 optimized SASS schedule, and the RL agents can iteratively apply actions to mutate the current schedules. Positive rewards are generated if the mutated schedules get higher throughput by executing on GPUs. Experiments show that CuAsmRL can further improve the performance of existing specialized CUDA kernels transparently by up to 26%, and on average 9%. Moreover, it is used as a tool to reveal potential optimization moves learned automatically},

abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to drastically improve the landscape of computing education by automatically generating personalized feedback and content. In particular, this potential lies in the advanced capabilities of state-of-the-art deep generative and large language models such as OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[7], ChatGPT&nbsp;[11], and GPT-4&nbsp;[12]. In our work, we seek to investigate the capabilities of these models in visual programming domains popularly used for K-8 programming education, including domains like Scratch&nbsp;[17], Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5], and Karel&nbsp;[13]. Recent works have shown us sparks of advanced capabilities of such models for various education scenarios in introductory Python programming&nbsp;[2, 14, 18, 20]. In fact, a study in 2022 had ranked Codex in the top quartile w.r.t students in a large Python programming course&nbsp;[8]. However, all these works consider only text-based Python programming and leave open the question of how well these models would perform for visual programming. The main research question is: Do state-of-the-art neural generative models show advanced capabilities for visual programming on par with their capabilities on text-based Python programming?In our work, we evaluate these models for visual programming based on the following three settings designed to capture various generative and problem-solving capabilities: We conduct our evaluation based on 10 representative tasks from two visual programming domains: Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org&nbsp;[4, 5] and Intro to Programming with Karel course by CodeHS.com&nbsp;[3, 13]. As illustrative examples, Figures&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 show the output of GPT-4 in three settings for Maze18 task. We will provide the detailed analysis and prompts used in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results for ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 show that these models perform poorly and produce incorrect output the majority of the time. These results highlight that state-of-the-art neural generative models like GPT-4 still struggle to combine spatial, logical, and programming skills crucial for visual programming. As the next step, it would be important to curate novel benchmarks that the research community can use to evaluate improvements in future versions of these models for visual programming.},

abstract = {In recent years, the process humans adopt to learn a foreign language has moved from the strict "Grammar –Translation" method, which is based mainly on grammar and syntax rules, to more innovative processes, resulting to the more modern "Communicative approach". As its name states, this approach focuses on the coherent communication with native speakers and the cultivation of oral skills, without taking into consideration, at least at the first stages, the rules that govern the language. The same trend seems to have been applied to the way machinery can be "educated" to comprehend and reproduce the unfamiliar, human language. The "rule based" Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms, on one hand, and the "text based" Large Language Models (LLMs), on the other, are two, analogous to the two human foreign language learning processes, subareas of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper presents these two alternative approaches, LLMs (a technology having surfaced as an influential catalyst of NLP, during last years) on the one hand and NLG/NLU on the other, highlighting their applications, their technologies, their capabilities, their differences, their strengths and weaknesses and the challenges they present, contributing to a deeper comprehension of the evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence and human-computer communication.},

We contextualized the speech-to-content generation process to draw the audience's attention to the power and constraints of language. Additionally, we examine AI's comprehension of censored words and ethical considerations. Finally, our artistic project proposes the aphorism "Language as a virus, art as an antibody," offering novel perspectives on language taboos and art-technology intersections.},

abstract = {Recommendation foundation model utilizes large language models (LLM) for recommendation by converting recommendation tasks into natural language tasks. It enables generative recommendation which directly generates the item(s) to recommend rather than calculating a ranking score for each and every candidate item as in traditional recommendation models, simplifying the recommendation pipeline from multi-stage filtering to single-stage filtering. To avoid generating excessively long text and hallucinated recommendations when deciding which item(s) to recommend, creating LLM-compatible item IDs to uniquely identify each item is essential for recommendation foundation models. In this study, we systematically examine the item ID creation and indexing problem for recommendation foundation models, using P5 as an example of the backbone LLM. To emphasize the importance of item indexing, we first discuss the issues of several trivial item indexing methods, such as random indexing, title indexing, and independent indexing. We then propose four simple yet effective solutions, including sequential indexing, collaborative indexing, semantic (content-based) indexing, and hybrid indexing. Our study highlights the significant influence of item indexing methods on the performance of LLM-based recommendation, and our results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions. The research also demonstrates how recent advances on language modeling and traditional IR principles such as indexing can help each other for better learning and inference.

However, programmers need to manually exercise the program to reach an interesting state or write code that reproducibly executes a functionality with concrete inputs to be able to observe concrete data. This work aims to automate this process by leveraging generative AI. We present a framework and a preliminary Smalltalk-based prototype allowing programmers to obtain and run examples for the currently viewed source code section from a large language model. Our approach demonstrates how locally hosted LLMs can be fine-tuned and used for such a task with reasonable computational effort while minimizing common problems like hallucinations and out-of-date knowledge.

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) systems have received exponential growth in popularity and have become ubiquitous in our everyday life. Such systems are built on top of popular DL libraries, e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch which provide APIs as building blocks for DL systems. Detecting bugs in these DL libraries is critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness/safety for end users. Meanwhile, traditional fuzzing techniques can be hardly effective for such a challenging domain since the input DL programs need to satisfy both the input language (e.g., Python) syntax/semantics and the DL API input/shape constraints for tensor computations.  
To address these limitations, we propose TitanFuzz – the first approach to directly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs for fuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are titanic models trained on billions of code snippets and can autoregressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key insight is that modern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL library APIs in their training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn both language syntax/semantics and intricate DL API constraints for valid DL program generation. More specifically, we use both generative and infilling LLMs (e.g., Codex/InCoder) to generate and mutate valid/diverse input DL programs for fuzzing. Our experimental results demonstrate that TitanFuzz can achieve 30.38%/50.84% higher code coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers on TensorFlow/PyTorch. Furthermore, TitanFuzz is able to detect 65 bugs, with 44 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs.  
This paper demonstrates that modern titanic LLMs can be leveraged to directly perform both generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing studied for decades, while being fully automated, generalizable, and applicable to domains challenging for traditional approaches (such as DL systems). We hope TitanFuzz can stimulate more work in this promising direction of LLMs for fuzzing.},

Our study extends these findings by demonstrating the benefits of explanations for neural rankers. By utilizing LLMs such as GPT-3.5 to enrich retrieval datasets with explanations, we trained a sequence-to-sequence ranking model, dubbed ExaRanker, to generate relevance labels and explanations for query-document pairs. The ExaRanker model, finetuned on a limited number of examples and synthetic explanations, exhibits performance comparable to models finetuned on three times more examples, but without explanations. Moreover, incorporating explanations imposes no additional computational overhead into the reranking step and allows for on-demand explanation generation.

abstract = {Survey data are common and invaluable in social science research for understanding population processes and supporting policymaking and planning. Depending on the nature and scale, survey data sharing comes with privacy risks, and data collectors and agencies are constrained by disclosure permissions, limiting usage across research groups and institutes. Previous methods for synthetic data generation and deidentification may not entirely prevent information disclosures, or they may sacrifice data quality and granularity.Using a large-scale national voter file at both national and state levels, this paper introduces an end-to-end pipeline to streamline synthetic data generation and evaluation for survey researchers. This study selects four generative approaches based on different statistical assumptions: the regression-based Synthpop, the generative deep learning-based CTGAN and TVAE, and the large language model-based REaLDTabFormer, and compares them to the baseline synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We consider three key dimensions of evaluation (utility, fidelity, and privacy) to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and systematically evaluate across various datasets and training sizes. The results reveal that Synthpop is optimized for general utility (i.e., fidelity), while TVAE excels in downstream applications (i.e., target-specific utility) but compromises on general utility and potentially risks data overfitting. REaLDTabFormer demonstrates a balanced performance in both general and target-specific utility, whereas CTGAN offers the best privacy protection. We recommend that future researchers select a generative method by considering the trade-offs between performance across various evaluation dimensions, training size, data type, and computational infrastructure.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) have significantly propelled the field of generation tasks. Text-to-Audio (TTA), a burgeoning generation application designed to generate audio from natural language prompts, is attracting increasing attention. However, existing TTA studies often struggle with generation quality and text-audio alignment, especially for complex textual inputs. Drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models, we introduce Auffusion, a TTA system adapting T2I model frameworks to TTA task, by effectively leveraging their inherent generative strengths and precise cross-modal alignment. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that Auffusion surpasses previous TTA approaches using limited data and computational resources. Furthermore, the text encoder serves as a critical bridge between text and audio, since it acts as an instruction for the diffusion model to generate coherent content. Previous studies in T2I recognize the significant impact of encoder choice on cross-modal alignment, like fine-grained details and object bindings, while similar evaluation is lacking in prior TTA works. Through comprehensive ablation studies and innovative cross-attention map visualizations, we provide insightful assessments, being the first to reveal the internal mechanisms in the TTA field and intuitively explain how different text encoders influence the diffusion process. Our findings reveal Auffusion's superior capability in generating audios that accurately match textual descriptions, which is further demonstrated in several related tasks, such as audio style transfer, inpainting, and other manipulations.},

abstract = {In the last decade there has been a significant leap in the capability of foundation AI models, largely driven by the introduction and refinement of transformer-based machine learning architectures. The most visible consequence of this has been the explosion of interest and application of large language models such as ChatGPT. This is one exemplar of how a foundation model trained on a huge amount of data can be specialised for particular task, often by a phase of reinforcement learning with human feedback.Within the AI community "performance" of such systems is generally taken to mean how well they respond to their users on characteristics such as accuracy, verifiability, and bias. Performance analysis usually considers both the responsiveness of a system to its user and the efficiency and equity of resource use. These foundation models rely on massive amounts of resource but there appears to have been little work considering how to understand the resource use or the trade-offs that exist between how the system responds to users and the amount of resource used.In this talk I will present initial ideas of what it could mean to develop a framework of performance evaluation for foundation models such as large language models. Such a framework would need to take into consideration the distinct phases of operation for these models, which broadly speaking can be categorised as training, generating and fine-tuning. Evaluating the trade-off between user interests and resource management will require the identification of suitable metrics. Resources in such systems are more than simply compute and storage use, and bandwidth; data and even human resources also play crucial roles in training and fine-tuning. I will discuss all these topics.},

However, the timing of developers seeking assistance from ChatGPT and their perceptions of ChatGPT-generated content remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze a dataset comprising 211 developers' shared conversations with ChatGPT within GitHub Pull Requests (PRs). Our study investigates the events in the GitHub PR timeline that precede these shared conversations, the sentiments expressed by developers when sharing these conversations, and the reactions from other developers to PR comments and descriptions that include shared conversations with ChatGPT. Our key findings are: (1) Shared conversations with ChatGPT are posted after seven distinct types of pull request timeline events, with the most frequent being comments added, PR creation, and review requests. (2) Positive sentiment is the most prevalent among developers when sharing these conversations, followed by neutral and negative sentiments. Developer reactions to comments and PR descriptions containing shared conversations are generally sparse; when they do occur, the most common reactions are (thumbs up), (heart), and (eyes). These findings provide new insights into how developers incorporate FM-powered tools into their collaborative software development workflows.},

Our approach leverages the compositionality of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), a widely used parameter-efficient tuning technique. We commence by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with LoRA on selected tasks pertinent to hateful meme detection, thereby generating a suite of LoRA modules. These modules are capable of essential reasoning skills for hateful meme detection. We then use the few available annotated samples to train a module composer, which assigns weights to the LoRA modules based on their relevance. The model's learnable parameters are directly proportional to the number of LoRA modules. This modularized network, underpinned by LLMs and augmented with LoRA modules, exhibits enhanced generalization in the context of hateful meme detection. Our evaluation spans three datasets designed for hateful meme detection in a few-shot learning context. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to traditional in-context learning, which is also more computationally intensive during inference.},

abstract = {High-quality conversational datasets are crucial for the successful development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) backend. Synthetic student-teacher dialogues, generated using advanced GPT-4 models, are a common strategy for creating these datasets. However, subjects like physics that entail complex calculations pose a challenge. While GPT-4 presents impressive language processing capabilities, its limitations in fundamental mathematical reasoning curtail its efficacy for such subjects. To tackle this limitation, we introduce in this paper an innovative stateful prompt design. Our design orchestrates a mock conversation where both student and tutorbot roles are simulated by GPT-4. Each student response triggers an internal monologue, or ‘code soliloquy’ in the GPT-tutorbot, which assesses whether its subsequent response would necessitate calculations. If a calculation is deemed necessary, it scripts the relevant Python code and uses the Python output to construct a response to the student. Our approach notably enhances the quality of synthetic conversation datasets, especially for subjects that are calculation-intensive. The preliminary Subject Matter Expert evaluations reveal that our Higgs model, a fine-tuned LLaMA model, effectively uses Python for computations, which significantly enhances the accuracy and computational reliability of Higgs’ responses.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of LLMs, which is of paramount importance due to often vast generation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this article, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art LLMs. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 20,543 public-accessible LLMs, we observe a fundamental property in LLMs that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our interesting observation is that the output length determines the computation efficiency of LLMs instead of the input, where the output length depends on two factors: an often sufficiently large yet pessimistic pre-configured threshold controlling the max number of iterations and a runtime-generated end of sentence (EOS) token. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that LLMs would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present LLMEffiChecker, which can work under both white-box setting and black-box setting. In the white-box scenario, LLMEffiChecker develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level. In the black-box scenario, LLMEffiChecker employs a causal inference-based approach to find critical tokens and similarly applies three levels of imperceptible perturbation to them. Both the white-box and black-box settings effectively delay the appearance of EOS, compelling these inputs to reach the naturally unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMEffiChecker, we conduct a systematic evaluation on nine publicly available LLMs: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, Helsinki-NLP translator, Facebook FairSeq, UNICAMP-DL translator, MarianMT, Google FLAN-T5, MBZUAI LaMini-GPT, and Salesforce CodeGen. Experimental results show that LLMEffiChecker can increase on average LLMs’ response latency and energy consumption by 325% to 3,244% and 344% to 3,616%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study shows that inputs generated by LLMEffiChecker significantly affect the battery power in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than normal inputs).},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success across various domains, but their capability in understanding and resolving complex graph problems is less explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GraphInstruct, a novel instruction-tuning dataset aimed at enabling language models to tackle a broad spectrum of graph problems through explicit reasoning paths. Utilizing GraphInstruct, we build GraphWiz, an open-source language model capable of solving various graph computational problems while generating clear reasoning processes. To further enhance the model's performance and reliability, we integrate the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework within the graph problem-solving context. The improved model, GraphWiz-DPO, achieves an average accuracy of 65% across nine tasks with different complexity levels, surpassing GPT-4 which has an average accuracy of 43.8%. Our study also investigates the relationship between training data volume and model performance, emphasizing the risk of overfitting as data volume increases. Additionally, we explore the transferability of the proposed model across different tasks and datasets, demonstrating its robust zero-shot generalization capability. GraphWiz offers a new blueprint and valuable insights for developing LLMs specialized in graph reasoning and problem-solving.},

abstract = {Modern transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are constructed with a series of decoder blocks. Each block comprises three key components: (1) QKV generation, (2) multi-head attention, and (3) feed-forward networks. In batched processing, QKV generation and feed-forward networks involve compute-intensive matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM), while multi-head attention requires bandwidth-heavy matrix-vector multiplications (GEMV). Machine learning accelerators like TPUs or NPUs are proficient in handling GEMM but are less efficient for GEMV computations. Conversely, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) technology is tailored for efficient GEMV computation, while it lacks the computational power to handle GEMM effectively.Inspired by this insight, we propose NeuPIMs, a heterogeneous acceleration system that jointly exploits a conventional GEMM-focused NPU and GEMV-optimized PIM devices. The main challenge in efficiently integrating NPU and PIM lies in enabling concurrent operations on both platforms, each addressing a specific kernel type. First, existing PIMs typically operate in a "blocked" mode, allowing only either NPU or PIM to be active at any given time. Second, the inherent dependencies between GEMM and GEMV in LLMs restrict their parallel processing. To tackle these challenges, NeuPIMs is equipped with dual row buffers in each bank, facilitating the simultaneous management of memory read/write operations and PIM commands. Further, NeuPIMs employs a runtime sub-batch interleaving technique to maximize concurrent execution, leveraging batch parallelism to allow two independent sub-batches to be pipelined within a single NeuPIMs device. Our evaluation demonstrates that compared to GPU-only, NPU-only, and a na\"{\i}ve NPU+PIM integrated acceleration approaches, NeuPIMs achieves 3\texttimes{}, 2.4\texttimes{} and 1.6\texttimes{} throughput improvement, respectively.},

abstract = {The rapid development of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has significantly enhanced the performance of machine reading comprehension (MRC). Nevertheless, the traditional fine-tuning approaches necessitate extensive labeled data. MRC remains a challenging task in the few-shot settings or low-resource scenarios. This study proposes a novel few-shot MRC approach via post-training and answer span-oriented contrastive learning, termed MRC-PASCL. Specifically, in the post-training module, a novel noun-entity-aware data selection and generation strategy is proposed according to characteristics of MRC task and data, focusing on masking nouns and named entities in the context. In terms of fine-tuning, the proposed answer span-oriented contrastive learning manner selects spans around the golden answers as negative examples, and performs multi-task learning together with the standard MRC answer prediction task. Experimental results show that MRC-PASCL outperforms the PLMs-based baseline models and the 7B and 13B large language models (LLMs) cross most MRQA 2019 datasets. Further analyses show that our approach achieves better inference efficiency with lower computational resource requirement. The analysis results also indicate that the proposed method can better adapt to the domain-specific scenarios.},

abstract = {Product attribute value extraction is a pivotal component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the contemporary e-commerce industry. The provision of precise product attribute values is fundamental in ensuring high-quality recommendations and enhancing customer satisfaction. The recently emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated state of-the-art performance in numerous attribute extraction tasks, without the need for domain-specific training data. Nevertheless, varying strengths and weaknesses are exhibited by different LLMs due to the diversity in data, architectures, and hyperparameters. This variation makes them complementary to each other, with no single LLM dominating all others. Considering the diverse strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, it becomes necessary to develop an ensemble method that leverages their complementary potentials.In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called LLM-ensemble to ensemble different LLMs' outputs for attribute value extraction. We iteratively learn the weights for different LLMs to aggregate the labels with weights to predict the final attribute value. Not only can our proposed method be proven theoretically optimal, but it also ensures efficient computation, fast convergence, and safe deployment. We have also conducted extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs on Walmart's internal data. Our offline metrics demonstrate that the LLM-ensemble method outperforms all the state-of-the-art single LLMs on Walmart's internal dataset. This method has been launched in several production models, leading to improved Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate (CVR), and Add-to-Cart Rate (ATC).},

However, the reliability of these models in terms of factual accuracy and timely knowledge acquisition remains a challenge. Researchers explore the implementation of retrieval-augmented generation methods, aiming to enhance the authenticity and specificity in knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper discusses the practical application in industrial settings, particularly in assisting design personnel with navigating complex standards and quality manuals. Utilizing an open-source model with 6 billion parameters, the study employs quantization technology for local deployment, addressing computational challenges. The retrieval-augmented generation framework is analyzed, emphasizing the integration of document parsing, vector databases, and text embedding models. Experimental results compare models at different quantization levels, revealing trade-offs between response time, model size, and performance metrics. The findings suggest that 4-bit integer quantization is optimal for standard document retrieval and question-answering tasks, highlighting practical considerations for CPU inference. The paper concludes with insights into hyper-parameter tuning, model comparisons, and future optimizations for enhanced performance in edge device deployments of large language models.},

abstract = {Dataflow graphs (DFGs) capture definitions (defs) and uses across program blocks, which is a fundamental program representation for program analysis, testing and maintenance. However, dynamically typed programming languages like Python present implicit dataflow issues that make it challenging to determine def-use flow information at compile time. Static analysis methods like Soot and WALA are inadequate for handling these issues, and manually enumerating comprehensive heuristic rules is impractical. Large pre-trained language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, as they have powerful language understanding and pattern matching abilities, allowing them to predict implicit dataflow by analyzing code context and relationships between variables, functions, and statements in code. We propose leveraging LLMs’ in-context learning ability to learn implicit rules and patterns from code representation and contextual information to solve implicit dataflow problems. To further enhance the accuracy of LLMs, we design a five-step chain of thought (CoT) and break it down into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chain, with each step corresponding to a separate AI unit to generate accurate DFGs for Python code. Our approach’s performance is thoroughly assessed, demonstrating the effectiveness of each AI unit in the AI Chain. Compared to static analysis, our method achieves 82% higher def coverage and 58% higher use coverage in DFG generation on implicit dataflow. We also prove the indispensability of each unit in the AI Chain. Overall, our approach offers a promising direction for building software engineering tools by utilizing foundation models, eliminating significant engineering and maintenance effort, but focusing on identifying problems for AI to solve.},

This pipeline dynamically generates interaction scenarios, avatar profiles, and adaptive responses based on researcher input. By integrating with Unity, GIDEA enables real-time monitoring and control over simulated experiments, providing researchers with an interactive and adaptable evaluation environment. Through the replication of real-world case studies, we demonstrate that GIDEA reduces the time and effort required for HCI experiments while producing results that align with real studies. This capability has the potential to revolutionize HCI research by transforming traditionally lengthy and labor-intensive processes into a highly efficient, scalable, and adaptive methodology, accelerating innovation and broadening experimental possibilities.},

abstract = {Modern computing relies on System-on-Chips (SoCs), integrating IP cores for complex functions. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities, necessitating rigorous hardware security validation. The effectiveness of this validation depends on the security properties embedded in the SoC. Recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) for generating security properties, but these may not be directly optimized for validation. Manual intervention remains necessary to reduce their number. Security validation methods that rely on human expertise are not scalable as they are time-intensive and prone to human error. In order to address these issues, we introduce Assert-O, an automated framework designed to derive security properties from SoC documentation and optimize the generated properties. It also ranks the properties based on the security vulnerabilities they are associated with, thereby streamlining the validation process. Our method leverages hardware documentation to initially create security properties, which are subsequently consolidated and prioritized based on their level of criticality. This approach serves to expedite the validation procedure. Assert-O is trained on documentation of six IPs from OpenTitan. To evaluate our proposed method, Assert-O was assessed on five other modules from OpenTitan. Assert-O was able to generate 183 properties, which was further optimized to reduce them to 138 properties. Subsequently, these properties were ranked based on their impact on the security of the overall system.},

abstract = {One of the primary areas of interest in High Performance Computing is the improvement of performance of parallel workloads. Nowadays, compilable source code-based optimization tasks that employ deep learning often exploit LLVM Intermediate Representations (IRs) for extracting features from source code. Most such works target specific tasks, or are designed with a pre-defined set of heuristics. So far, pre-trained models are rare in this domain, but the possibilities have been widely discussed. Especially approaches mimicking large-language models (LLMs) have been proposed. But these have prohibitively large training costs. In this paper, we propose MIREncoder, a Multi-modal IR-based Auto-Encoder that can be pre-trained to generate a learned embedding space to be used for downstream tasks by machine learning-based approaches. A multi-modal approach enables us to better extract features from compilable programs. It allows us to better model code syntax, semantics and structure. For code-based performance optimizations, these features are very important while making optimization decisions. A pre-trained model/embedding implicitly enables the usage of transfer learning, and helps move away from task-specific trained models. Additionally, a pre-trained model used for downstream performance optimization should itself have reduced overhead, and be easily usable. These considerations have led us to propose a modeling approach that i) understands code semantics and structure, ii) enables use of transfer learning, and iii) is small and simple enough to be easily re-purposed or reused even with low resource availability. Our evaluations will show that our proposed approach can outperform the state of the art while reducing overhead.},

abstract = {The recent advances in Multimodal AI &amp; Generative AI open doors to the possibilities of solving key challenges for Persons with Learning Disability. To assist individuals facing difficulty in visual or auditory perception, this paper designs &amp; develops a multimodal AI agent using recent advances in the field. We aim to solve the challenge of enabling persons with Visual or Auditory Processing Disorders to learn &amp; communicate. We do this by exploring a design that allows the transformation of information across visual and language modalities. This design can be realized with the recent advances in Generative Multimodal AI. Based on each individual's needs, the AI agent dynamically adapts the Human Computer interaction model. For instance, for a child with Visual Processing Disorder (VPD), given the child's hindered ability to make sense of information taken in through the eyes, the Multimodal AI agent transforms any visual information into auditory user interaction. In another instance, for a person with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), given the hindrance in the individual's ability to analyze information taken in through the ears, the AI dynamically translates any speech modality into visual cues. Thus the AI agent adapts dynamically to the strengths and abilities of the individual. To enable students with VPD to learn, the design allows the student to ask questions about an image. This design is realized as a Visual Question Answering task in Vision Language Transformer models. We explore interactive multimodal conversations with Few shot Learning and In-Context Instruction Tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models to address difficulty in visual reasoning. To enable persons with CAPD to learn, the design translates audio lectures into visual cues. This visual cue consists of a combination of words using speech recognition and Large Language Models based re-phrasing to simpler words, cross-modal retrieval of images to address auditory memory challenges, and AI-generated images. To identify the strengths of each child, we also explore Multimodal embedding based Multimodal latent space arithmetic to link AI across senses. To effectively integrate the proposed design into the mainstream, we explore a universal design based inclusive approach to extend the use case to create AI assistants for assisting children with different learning styles such as visual learners or auditory learners. To enable future research on the proposed design, we explore an architecture to compose a pipeline of AI models, and to connect with external systems via plugin connectors. We implement lab scale prototypes of this design and present a demo on the project webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/multimodallearningdisability.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of code generation tools powered by large language models has attracted wide attention. Models such as OpenAI Codex can take natural language problem descriptions as input and generate highly accurate source code solutions, with potentially significant implications for computing education. Given the many complexities that students face when learning to write code, they may quickly become reliant on such tools without properly understanding the underlying concepts. One popular approach for scaffolding the code writing process is to use Parsons problems, which present solution lines of code in a scrambled order. These remove the complexities of low-level syntax, and allow students to focus on algorithmic and design-level problem solving. It is unclear how well code generation models can be applied to solve Parsons problems, given the mechanics of these models and prior evidence that they underperform when problems include specific restrictions. In this paper, we explore the performance of the Codex model for solving Parsons problems over various prompt variations. Using a corpus of Parsons problems we sourced from the computing education literature, we find that Codex successfully reorders the problem blocks about half of the time, a much lower rate of success when compared to prior work on more free-form programming tasks. Regarding prompts, we find that small variations in prompting have a noticeable effect on model performance, although the effect is not as pronounced as between different problems.},

Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on huge amounts of human-written code/text, have shown remarkable performance in many code intelligence tasks due to their powerful generality, even without task-specific re-training/fine-tuning. Thus, LLMs can potentially circumvent the above limitations, but they have not been exhaustively explored yet. This paper investigates diverse LLMs and learning-based transpilers for automated code translation tasks, finding that: although certain LLMs have outperformed current transpilers, they still have some accuracy issues, where most of the failures are induced by a lack of comprehension of source programs (38.51%), missing clear instructions on I/O types in translation (14.94%), and ignoring discrepancies between source and target programs (41.38%).  Enlightened by the above findings, we further propose UniTrans, a Unified code Translation framework, applicable to various LLMs, for unleashing their power in this field. Specifically, UniTrans first crafts a series of test cases for target programs with the assistance of source programs. Next, it harnesses the above auto-generated test cases to augment the code translation and then evaluate their correctness via execution. Afterward, UniTrans further (iteratively) repairs incorrectly translated programs prompted by test case execution results. Extensive experiments are conducted on six settings of translation datasets between Python, Java, and C++. Three recent LLMs of diverse sizes, including GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-13B/7B, are tested with UniTrans, and all achieve substantial improvements in terms of computational accuracy and exact match accuracy among almost all translation settings, showing the universal effectiveness of UniTrans in practice.},

abstract = {Embodied carbon is the total amount of carbon released from the processes associated with a product from cradle to gate. In many industry sectors, embodied carbon dominates the overall carbon footprint. Embodied carbon accounting, i.e., to estimate the embodied carbon of a product, has become an important research topic. Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g., 28nm CPU, yet a product instance can be manufactured from diverse regions and in diverse time periods, e.g., in the winter in Ireland (Intel). It is known that carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial and temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a specific product instance can largely differ from its product class. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) models for embodied carbon accounting. We observe significant differences between current embodied carbon models and STEC models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference can be 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on key computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) inference and LLM training. We observe that using STEC models leads to much greater differences in the embodied accounting of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%). This is because the hardware requirements of certain applications allow for a wider range of hardware choices, while others have greater restrictions.},

Here we introduce DesignAID, a generative AI tool that supports broader design space exploration by first using large language models to produce a range of diverse ideas expressed in words, and then using image generation software to create images from these words. This innovative combination of AI-based capabilities allows human-computer pairs to rapidly create a diverse set of visual concepts without time-consuming drawing. In a study with 87 crowd-sourced designers, we found that designers rated the automatic generation of images from words as significantly more inspirational, enjoyable, and useful than a conventional baseline condition of image search using Pinterest. Surprisingly, however, we found that automatically generating highly diverse ideas had less value. For image generation, the high diversity condition was somewhat better in inspiration but no better in the other dimensions, and for image search it was significantly worse in all dimensions.},

While existing studies have successfully applied these models to medical dialogue systems, challenges remain in accurately calculating medication dosages and handling multi-turn reasoning due to the low tolerance for error in medical contexts. To address this, we propose Math Multi-step Reasoning in Medical Dialogue Generation (MMR), which enhances reasoning by iteratively breaking down complex problems into simpler questions using a “Least to Most Prompting” (LMP)strategy. MMR integrates Chain of Thought, React mechanisms, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a domain-specific knowledge base to improve reasoning accuracy.

abstract = {The use of machine learning for statistical modeling (and thus, generative modeling) has grown in popularity with the proliferation of time series models, text-to-image models, and especially large language models. Fundamentally, the goal of classical factor modeling is statistical modeling of stock returns, and in this work, we explore using deep generative modeling to enhance classical factor models. Prior work has explored the use of deep generative models in order to model hundreds of stocks, leading to accurate risk forecasting and alpha portfolio construction; however, that specific model does not allow for easy factor modeling interpretation in that the factor exposures cannot be deduced. In this work, we introduce NeuralFactors, a novel machine-learning based approach to factor analysis where a neural network outputs factor exposures and factor returns, trained using the same methodology as variational autoencoders. We show that this model outperforms prior approaches both in terms of log-likelihood performance and computational efficiency. Further, we show that this method is competitive to prior work in generating realistic synthetic data, covariance estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or VaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization. Finally, due to the connection to classical factor analysis, we analyze how the factors our model learns cluster together and show that the factor exposures could be used for embedding stocks.},

abstract = {In software engineering, interruptions during tasks can have significant implications for productivity and well-being. While previous studies have investigated the effect of interruptions on productivity, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has yet distinguished the effect of different types of interruptions on software engineering activities.This study explores the impact of interruptions on software engineering tasks, analyzing in-person and on-screen interruptions with different levels of urgency and dominance. Participants completed code writing, code comprehension, and code review tasks while experiencing interruptions. We collect physiological data using the Empatica EmbracePlus wristband and self-perceived evaluations through surveys. Results show that on-screen interruptions with high dominance of requester significantly increase time spent on code comprehension. In-person and on-screen interruptions combined significantly affect the time spent on code review, with varied effects based on specific interruption combinations. Both interruption type and task significantly influence stress measures, with code comprehension and review tasks associated with lower stress measures compared to code writing. Interestingly, in-person interruptions present a positive impact on physiological measures, indicating reduced stress measures. However, participants' self-perceived stress scores do not align with physiological data, with higher stress reported during in-person interruptions despite lower physiological stress measures. These findings shed light on and emphasize the potential importance of considering the complex relationship between interruptions, objective measures, and subjective experiences in software development. We discuss insights that we hope can inform interruption management and implications on stress among software engineers. (ChatGPT was used to revise and shorten paragraphs in this manuscript.)},

abstract = {Deep learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which perturbations to their inputs cause the model to produce incorrect predictions. As opposed to adversarial attacks in computer vision, where small changes introduced to pixel values can drastically alter a model's output while remaining imperceptible to humans, text-based attacks are difficult to conceal due to the discrete nature of tokens. Consequently, unconstrained gradient-based attacks often produce adversarial examples that lack semantic meaning, rendering them detectable through visual inspection or perplexity filters. In contrast to methods that rely on gradient-based optimization in the embedding space, we propose an approach that leverages a Large Language Model's ability to generate grammatically correct and semantically meaningful text to craft adversarial patches that seamlessly blend in with the original input text. These patches can be used to alter the behavior of a target model, such as a text classifier. Since our approach does not rely on gradient backpropagation, it only requires access to the target model's confidence scores, making it a grey-box attack. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using open-source LLMs, including Intel's Neural Chat, Llama2, and Mistral-Instruct, to generate adversarial patches capable of altering the predictions of a distilBERT model fine-tuned on the IMDB reviews dataset for sentiment classification.},

abstract = {Developing a generative model of realistic order flow in financial markets is a challenging open problem, with numerous applications for market participants. Addressing this, we propose the first end-to-end autoregressive generative model that generates tokenized limit order book (LOB) messages. These messages are interpreted by the JAX-LOB simulator, which updates the LOB state. To handle long sequences efficiently, the model employs simplified structured state-space layers to process sequences of order book states and tokenized messages. Using LOBSTER data of NASDAQ equity LOBs, we develop a custom tokenizer for message data, converting groups of successive digits to tokens, similar to tokenization in large language models. Out-of-sample results show promising performance in approximating the data distribution, as evidenced by low model perplexity. Furthermore, the mid-price returns calculated from the generated order flow exhibit a significant correlation with the data, indicating impressive conditional forecast performance. Due to the granularity of generated data, and the accuracy of the model, it offers new application areas for future work beyond forecasting, e.g. acting as a world model in high-frequency financial reinforcement learning applications. Overall, our results invite the use and extension of the model in the direction of autoregressive large financial models for the generation of high-frequency financial data. 1},

Objectives: Achievement Goals are well studied in computing education and can be predictive of student interest and exam performance. The objective in this study is to compare findings from prior achievement goal studies in CS1 courses with new CS1 courses that emphasize the use of human-GenAI collaborative coding. Methods: In a CS1 course that integrates GenAI, we use linear regression to explore the relationship between achievement goals and prior experience on student interest, exam performance, and perceptions of GenAI. Results: As with prior findings in traditional CS1 classes, Mastery goals are correlated with interest in computing. Contradicting prior CS1 findings, normative goals are correlated with exam scores. Normative and mastery goals correlate with students’ perceptions of learning with GenAI. Mastery goals weakly correlate with reading and testing code output from GenAI.},

abstract = {Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific programming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between developers’ natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. In a retrieval-augmented framework, similar data can be retrieved from the database using a retrieval algorithm, and original input data can be fused with retrieved data by different fusion strategies. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.},

abstract = {Recent language models have demonstrated proficiency in summarizing source code. However, as in many other domains of machine learning, language models of code lack sufficient explainability --- informally, we lack a formulaic or intuitive understanding of what and how models learn from code. Explainability of language models can be partially provided if, as the models learn to produce higher-quality code summaries, they also align in deeming the same code parts important as those identified by human programmers. In this paper, we report negative results from our investigation of explainability of language models in code summarization through the lens of human comprehension. We measure human focus on code using eye-tracking metrics such as fixation counts and duration in code summarization tasks. To approximate language model focus, we employ a state-of-the-art model-agnostic, black-box, perturbation-based approach, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to identify which code tokens influence that generation of summaries. Using these settings, we find no statistically significant relationship between language models' focus and human programmers' attention. Furthermore, alignment between model and human foci in this setting does not seem to dictate the quality of the LLM-generated summaries. Our study highlights an inability to align human focus with SHAP-based model focus measures. This result calls for future investigation of multiple open questions for explainable language models for code summarization and software engineering tasks in general, including the training mechanisms of language models for code, whether there is an alignment between human and model attention on code, whether human attention can improve the development of language models, and what other model focus measures are appropriate for improving explainability.},

abstract = {The increasing reliance on machine learning models in scientific research and day-to-day applications – and the near-opacity of their associated computational methods – creates a widely recognized need to enable others to verify results coming from Machine Learning Pipelines. In this work we use an empirical approach to build on efforts to define and deploy structured publication standards that allow machine learning research to be automatically assessed and verified, enabling greater reliability and trust in results. To automate the assessment of a set of publication standards for Machine Learning Pipelines we developed Reproscreener; a novel, open-source software tool (see https://reproscreener.org/). We benchmark Reproscreener’s automatic reproducibility assessment against a novel manually labeled “gold standard” dataset of machine learning arXiv preprints. Our empirical evaluation has a dual goal: to assess Reproscreener’s performance; and to uncover gaps and opportunities in current reproducibility standards. We develop reproducibility assessment metrics we called the Repo Metrics to provide a novel overall assessment of the re-executability potential of the Machine Learning Pipeline, called the ReproScore. We used two approaches to the automatic identification of reproducibility metrics, keywords and LLM tools, and found the reproducibility metric evaluation performance of Large Language Model (LLM) tools superior to keyword associations.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that large language models (LLM) unintendedly memorize part of the training data, which brings serious privacy risks. For example, it has been shown that over 1% of tokens generated unprompted by an LLM are part of sequences in the training data. However, current studies mainly focus on the exact memorization behaviors. In this paper, we propose to evaluate how many generated texts have near-duplicates (e.g., only differ by a couple of tokens out of 100) in the training corpus. A major challenge of conducting this evaluation is the huge computation cost incurred by near-duplicate sequence searches. This is because modern LLMs are trained on larger and larger corpora with up to 1 trillion tokens. What's worse is that the number of sequences in a text is quadratic to the text length. To address this issue, we develop an efficient and scalable near-duplicate sequence search algorithm in this paper. It can find (almost) all the near-duplicate sequences of the query sequence in a large corpus with guarantees. Specifically, the algorithm generates and groups the min-hash values of all the sequences with at least t tokens (as very short near-duplicates are often irrelevant noise) in the corpus in linear time to the corpus size. We formally prove that only 2 n+1/t+1 -1 min-hash values are generated for a text with n tokens in expectation. Thus the index time and size are reasonable. When a query arrives, we find all the sequences sharing enough min-hash values with the query using inverted indexes and prefix filtering. Extensive experiments on a few large real-world LLM training corpora show that our near-duplicate sequence search algorithm is efficient and scalable.},

abstract = {Before implementing a function, programmers are encouraged to write a purpose statement i.e., a short, natural-language explanation of what the function computes. A purpose statement may be ambiguous i.e., it may fail to specify the intended behaviour when two or more inequivalent computations are plausible on certain inputs. Our paper makes four contributions. First, we propose a novel heuristic that suggests such inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs). Using these suggestions, the programmer may choose to clarify the purpose statement (e.g., by providing a functional example that specifies the intended behaviour on such an input). Second, to assess the quality of inputs suggested by our heuristic, and to facilitate future research, we create an open dataset of purpose statements with known ambiguities. Third, we compare our heuristic against GitHub Copilot’s Chat feature, which can suggest similar inputs when prompted to generate unit tests. Fourth, we provide an open-source implementation of our heuristic as an extension to Visual Studio Code for the Python programming language, where purpose statements and functional examples are specified as docstrings and doctests respectively. We believe that this tool will be particularly helpful to novice programmers and instructors.},

abstract = {The upsurge in pre-trained large models started by ChatGPT has swept across the entire deep learning community. Such powerful models demonstrate advanced generative ability and multimodal understanding capability, which quickly set new state of the arts on a variety of benchmarks. The pre-trained LLM usually plays the role as a universal AI model that can conduct various tasks like article analysis and image comprehension. However, due to the prohibitively high memory and computational cost of implementing such a large model, the conventional models (such as CNN and ViT) are still essential for many visual perception tasks. In this paper, we propose to enhance the representation ability of ordinary vision models on perception tasks (e.g. image classification) by taking advantage of the off-the-shelf large pre-trained models. We present a new learning framework, dubbed GPT4Image, where the knowledge of the large pre-trained models are extracted to help CNNs and ViTs learn better representations and achieve higher performance. Firstly, we curate a high quality description set by prompting a multimodal LLM to generate descriptions for training images. Then, these detailed descriptions are fed into a pre-trained encoder to extract text embeddings that encodes the rich semantics of images. During training, text embeddings will serve as extra supervising signal and be aligned with image representations learned by vision models. The alignment process helps vision models achieve better performance with the aid of pre-trained LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various visual perception tasks for heterogeneous model architectures.},

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical aspect of learning and problem-solving for computing students. Recent research has shown that many students are aware of generative AI (GenAI) tools; however, there are gaps in the extent and effectiveness of how students use them. With over two years of widespread GenAI usage, it is crucial to understand whether students' help-seeking behaviors with these tools have evolved and how. This paper presents findings from a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted among computing students across North American universities ( n=95 ). Our results indicate shifts in GenAI usage patterns. In 2023, 34.1% of students ( n=47 ) reported never using ChatGPT for help, ranking it fourth after online searches, peer support, and class forums. By 2024, this figure dropped sharply to 6.3% ( n=48 ), with ChatGPT nearly matching online search as the most commonly used help resource. Despite this growing prevalence, there has been a decline in students' hourly and daily usage of GenAI tools, which may be attributed to a common tendency to underestimate usage frequency. These findings offer new insights into the evolving role of GenAI in computing education, highlighting its increasing acceptance and solidifying its position as a key help resource.},

Thus, agents should plan their interactions based on objects’ affordances and the current situation to achieve acceptable outcomes. How to support intelligent agents’ planning of affordance-based interactions compatible with human perception and values in real-world contexts remains under-explored. We conducted a formative study identifying the physical, intrapersonal, and interpersonal contexts that count to household human-agent interaction. We then proposed ACKnowledge, a computational framework integrating a dynamic knowledge graph, a large language model, and a vision language model for affordance-based interaction planning in dynamic human environments. In evaluations, ACKnowledge generated acceptable planning results with an understandable process. In real-world simulation tasks, ACKnowledge achieved a high execution success rate and overall acceptability, significantly enhancing usage-rights respectfulness and social appropriateness over baselines. The case study’s feedback demonstrated ACKnowledge’s negotiation and personalization capabilities toward an understandable planning process.},

By integrating machine learning models with high-performance computing systems, our system facilitates continuous system health monitoring. The paper introduces a taxonomy for classifying system issues into actionable categories of problems, while filtering out groups of messages that the system administrators would consider unimportant "noise". Finally, we experiment with using large language models as a message classifier, and share our results and experience with doing so.

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical way that students learn new concepts, acquire new skills, and get unstuck when problem-solving in their computing courses. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers students a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it is unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources along dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing students now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected survey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our results suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have not yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources that students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors. Finally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with generative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate benefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We discuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing classrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.},

abstract = {Automated analysis of programming data using code representation methods offers valuable services for programmers, from code completion to clone detection to bug detection. Recent studies show the effectiveness of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), pre-trained Transformer-based models, and graph-based embeddings in programming code representation. However, pre-trained large language models lack interpretability, while other embedding-based approaches struggle with extracting important information from large ASTs. This study proposes a novel Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN) to address these gaps by integrating different components: an optimized sequential subtree extraction process using Genetic algorithm optimization, a two-way embedding approach, and an attention network. We investigate the effectiveness of SANN by applying it to two different tasks: program correctness prediction and algorithm detection on two educational datasets containing both small and large-scale code snippets written in Java and C, respectively. The experimental results show SANN's competitive performance against baseline models from the literature, including code2vec, ASTNN, TBCNN, CodeBERT, GPT-2, and MVG, regarding accurate predictive power. Finally, a case study is presented to show the interpretability of our model prediction and its application for an important human-centered computing application, student modeling. Our results indicate the effectiveness of the SANN model in capturing important syntactic and semantic information from students' code, allowing the construction of accurate student models, which serve as the foundation for generating adaptive instructional support such as individualized hints and feedback.},

While scholars have looked at overall institutional guidance for the use of GenAI and reports have documented the response from schools in the form of broad guidance to instructors, we do not know what policies and practices instructors are actually adopting and how they are being communicated to students through course syllabi. To study instructors' policy guidance, we collected 98 computing course syllabi from 54 R1 institutions in the U.S. and studied the GenAI policies they adopted and the surrounding discourse. Our analysis shows that 1) most instructions related to GenAI use were as part of the academic integrity policy for the course and 2) most syllabi prohibited or restricted GenAI use, often warning students about the broader implications of using GenAI, e.g. lack of veracity, privacy risks, and hindering learning. Beyond this, there was wide variation in how instructors approached GenAI including a focus on how to cite GenAI use, conceptualizing GenAI as an assistant, often in an anthropomorphic manner, and mentioning specific GenAI tools for use. We discuss the implications of our findings and conclude with current best practices for instructors.},

abstract = {Extended Reality (XR) is quickly expanding “as the next major technology wave in personal computing”. Nevertheless, this expansion and adoption could also exclude certain disabled users, particularly people with visual impairment (VIP). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in their 2019 publication, there were at least 2.2 billion people with visual impairment, a number that is also estimated to have increased in recent years. Therefore, it is important to include disabled users, especially visually impaired people, in the design of Head-Mounted Displays and Extended Reality environments. Indeed, this objective can be pursued by incorporating Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) technology, which can assist visually impaired people. As a case study, this study employs different prompts that result in environment descriptions from an MLLM integrated into a virtual reality (VR) escape room. Therefore, six potential prompts were engineered to generate valuable outputs for visually impaired users inside a VR environment. These outputs were evaluated using the G-Eval, and VIEScore metrics. Even though, the results show that the prompt patterns provided a description that aligns with the user’s point of view, it is highly recommended to evaluate these outputs through “expected outputs” from Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Sighted Guides. Furthermore, the subsequent step in the process is to evaluate these outputs by visually impaired people themselves to identify the most effective prompt pattern.},

abstract = {Vulnerabilities in identity and access management (IAM) are one of the most common reasons for data breaches leading to adversarial impacts on security, privacy and compliance postures. Account breaches, incorrectly designed access control policies, weaknesses in authentication and credential management, vulnerable session management are some of the several security issues that lead to eventual compromise of the crown jewels leading to data breaches. The lifecycles of subjects and their identities, of objects and re- sources, and of the permissions and authorization policies are in- tertwined in a complex manner for each specific scenario. Often subjects, objects and permissions often are hard to be defined or isolated from each other, especially in the context of machine learn-ing. The evolution of these entities, and how their provenance is analyzed often is essential not only for forensic analysis of a breach but also should be a proactive ongoing process.  In order to manage the security issues and risks thereof, holistic end-to-end identity and access management in a secure and privacy- preserving manner is the need of yesterday, today and of the future. In the past couple of decades, we have encountered this problem time and again in various contexts in the settings of academic and industry research and in development/deployment of products, services and processes.  Three elements are the key ingredients in order to address this problem in a holistic manner: (1) graphs, (2) machine learning, and (3) decentralized computing (i.e., web3, blockchains). Further, with the advent of generative AI and large language models, the question arises about what problems they can help solve, or they can excerbate further, or what new challenges they can introduce. In this talk, I plan to delve into a discussion of the following: (a) the holistic and end-to-end nature of IAM, (b) the interplay between these three elements - graphs, machine learning, Web3 as well as generative AI, and how they can help, and (c) the research challenges that need to be addressed in order to reduce the security, privacy and compliance risks in identity and access management.},

abstract = {In the past years, a growing number of highly-automated systems has build on Artificial-Intelligence (AI) capabilities, for example, self-driving vehicles or predictive health-state diagnoses. As for any software system, there is a risk that misbehavior occurs (e.g., system failure due to bugs) or that malicious actors aim to misuse the system (e.g., generating attack scripts), which can lead to safety and security incidents. While software safety and security incidents have been studied in the past, we are not aware of research focusing on the specifics of AI incidents. With this paper, we aim to shed light on this gap through a case survey of 240 incidents that we elicited from four datasets comprising safety and security incidents involving AI from 2014 to 2023. Using manual data analyses and automated topic modeling, we derived relevant topics as well as the major issues and contexts in which the incidents occurred. We find that the topic of AI incidents is, not surprisingly, becoming more and more relevant, particularly in the contexts of autonomous driving and process-automation robotics. Regarding security and its intersection with safety, most incidents connect to generative AI (i.e., large-language models, deep fakes) and computer-vision systems (i.e., facial recognition). This emphasizes the importance of security to also ensure safety in the context of AI systems, with our results further revealing a high number of serious consequences (system compromise, human injuries) and major violations of confidentiality, integrity, availability, as well as authorization. We hope to support practitioners and researchers in understanding major safety and security issues to support the development of more secure, safe, and trustworthy AI systems.},

abstract = {Motivation. Software tests are a necessity in the development of software to secure functionality, reliability, and usability [10]; however, these tests are costly and time-consuming [6]. Although tool support for software testing has advanced, there remains considerable potential for enhancement. Many software tests are still devised manually, with the creation of unit tests being particularly laborious. Automating the generation of test cases is promising for streamlining this aspect of software testing [6].Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited capabilities in code generation [11, 13--15], test case generation [17], and various other domains [11]. The advancement of model performance of transformer-based LLMs is mainly achieved by expanding the model size in line with an increase in training data size [7, 8]. However, this approach leads to high computational costs which can only be afforded by corporations with significant financial resources. This highlights the need for transformer-based LLMs that perform well on a specific downstream task and are also cost-efficient. Addressing this, we focused on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of more resource-efficient transformer-based LLMs LLaMA 2 13B, Code Llama 13B, and Mistral 7B for the specific downstream task of generating test cases for mobile applications.Research questions. This work investigated: Does SFT enhance the capabilities of a transformer-based LLM in the specific downstream task of generating test cases for mobile applications while being cost-efficient and runnable on standard consumer hardware? Does the fine-tuned model outperform other state-of-the-art models in the task of test generation for mobile applications?Approach. Our approach is a modification of the ATHENATEST approach [16]. However, our approach focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both pre-trained and already fine-tuned transformer-based LLMs for the task of test case generation for mobile applications in Dart.The approach involves three steps, as illustrated in Figure 1. Firstly, a labeled dataset of corresponding input-output pairs (X, Y) was obtained to model the conditional probability P(Y|X; θ) [9, 12]. Dart code and corresponding test files were extracted from open-source GitHub repositories using Google BigQuery. These files were then matched using regular expressions, ensuring that each code file was matched with its corresponding test file based on matching base filenames. The dataset underwent quality filtering and deduplication, resulting in 16,252 input-output pairs, which was then divided into training (90%) and validation (10%) sets. The training set of the dataset consists of a total of 88.5M tokens using the LLaMA tokenizer.Secondly, for SFT on the downstream task of test generation, models were selected based on their code generation capabilities, as indicated by the pass@1 score on the HumanEval [2] and MBPP [1] benchmark, their parameter sizes, and the extent to which they had been trained on Dart data. In model selection, open-source models capable of running on cost-efficient consumer hardware with code generation abilities were primarily chosen.Thirdly, in the SFT process, the test generation task was represented as translation task, in line with ATHENATEST [16]. This is achieved by employing the following structured prompt format for SFT [9]:"{prefix_prompt} ### Code: {code} ### Test: {test}"In this work, there was no prefix prompt used during SFT.Fine-tuning. The fine-tuning was conducted on a single GPU system using Flash Attention 2 [3] and the QLoRA method [4] to reduce memory size and the number of trainable parameters. The fine-tuning process varied in duration up to 32 hours, resulting in total emissions of 13.099 kgCO2eq [5].Experimental Results. The performance of TestGen-Dart models was evaluated for their unit testing capabilities in Dart, in comparison to base models LLaMA 2 13B, Code Llama 13B, and Mistral 7B. The models were loaded in both float16 and 4-bit quantization configurations, and the evaluation involved nine different Dart files, encompassing 42 test cases. The results were obtained in a zero-shot setting using a structured prompt format, as described in the approach section. This included a prefix prompt instructing the models to generate unit tests: "Generate unit tests in Dart for the following class. The unit test should be structured with the 'test' function, an appropriate description, and an assertion 'expect' within the function to validate the test case." The generated unit tests were classified into three categories: syntax errors (SE), syntactic correctness (SC), and functional correctness (FC). In a 4-bit quantization configuration, TestGen-Dart_v0.2 enhanced the generation of syntactically correct unit tests by 15.38% and functionally correct unit tests by 16.67%, compared to the underlying base model, Code Llama 13B. Additionally, TestGen-Dart_v0.2 demonstrated superior performance in the 16-bit configuration. This evidenced that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) increases the capability of transformer-based LLMs in a specific downstream task, in this instance, generating test cases for mobile applications, addressing the first research question posed in this work. Additionally, TestGen-Dart_v0.2 outperformed the other state-of-the-art models of interest LLaMA 2 13B and Mistral 7B in that task, addressing the second research question.Conclusion. This work demonstrates that SFT enhances the capability of transformer-based LLMs in generating test cases for mobile applications in Dart. Furthermore, the 13B parameter size of the TestGen-Dart enables it to run locally on standard consumer hardware, potentially making it a cost-efficient and privacy-friendly testing assistant for software developers by avoiding an external server connection to run the model.Outlook. Future work currently in progress may expand this approach to other programming languages and refine TestGen-Dart's performance by using higher-quality fine-tuning data either synthetic or human-annotated. Additionally, the evaluation method may be enhanced by using TestGen-Dart for generating test cases for dummy applications and measuring code coverage.},

abstract = {We introduce Robust Training with Trust Scores (RT2S), a framework to train machine learning classifiers with potentially noisy labels. RT2S calculates a trust score for each training sample, which indicates the quality of its corresponding label. These trust scores are employed as sample weights during training and optionally during threshold optimization. The trust scores are generated from two sources: (i) the model's confidence in the observed label, leveraging out-of-fold prediction scores to detect anomalous labels in the training data, and (ii) the probability of the correct label, ascertained by a Large Language Model with the ability to identify biased label noise. We evaluate RT2S by training machine learning models on 6 product classification datasets that utilize low-quality labels generated by a rule-based classification engine acting as a surrogate labeler. Our experimental findings indicate that RT2S outperforms all baselines, and achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.38% (max 7.18%) over rule-based classifiers in particular.},

This talk will present AI-powered improvements and continuing transformation of Google’s internal software development. This viewpoint comes from extensive experience with developing and deploying AI-based tools to surfaces where Google engineers spend the majority of their time, including inner loop activities such as code authoring, review and search, as well as outer loop ones such as bug management and planning. Improvements in these surfaces are monitored carefully for productivity and developer satisfaction. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
We will describe the challenges in how to align our internal efforts with the very fast moving field of LLMs. We need to constantly make judgment calls on technical feasibility, the possibility of iterative improvement and the measurability of impact as we decide what ideas to pursue for production level adaptation and adoption. The talk will go into several examples of this that we have gone through in recent past, and what we have learned in the process.
 
 
 

 
 
 
We will conclude the talk with changes that we expect to land in the next five years and some thoughts on how the community can collaborate better by focusing on good benchmarks.},

It requires distinguishing between original ideas and those generated by the model, assessing critical thinking skills, and gauging subject mastery accurately, which can impact fair assessment practices. The Human-Computer Interaction course described in this experience report has enabled consultation with textbooks, slides and other materials for over five years. This experience report describes reflections regarding using ChatGPT as a source of consultation in a written HCI exam in 2023. The paper describes experiences with analysis of the types of questions ChatGPT was able to solve immediately without mediation and the types of questions that could benefit from ChatGPT’s assistance without compromising the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes that professors want to analyse in teaching HCI. The paper uses Bloom’s taxonomy to analyse different questions and abilities to be evaluated and how they can be solved solely by using ChatGPT. The paper discusses questions that need mediation, previous lived experience in class and understanding of the knowledge acquired in class that cannot be answered directly by copying and pasting questions into ChatGPT. The discussions can raise reflections on the learning outcomes that can be assessed in HCI written exams and how professors should reflect upon their experiences and expectations for exams in the age of growing generative artificial intelligence resources.},

abstract = {In the realm of Software Engineering (SE), automation has become a tangible reality. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has suc-cessfully addressed challenges in project management, mod-eling, testing, and development. Among the latest innova-tions is ChatGPT, an ML-infused chatbot capable of gen-erating programming codes and software testing strategies. Although there is speculation that AI-based computation can boost productivity and even substitute software engineers in software development, empirical evidence supporting such claims is lacking. Moreover, questions remain about their po-tential to address overlooked evaluation metrics like energy efficiency, vulnerability, fairness (i.e., human bias), and safety. This paper probes into these issues with an empirical study, comparing ChatGPT with both novice and expert program-mers using LeetCode contest problems. The investigation focuses on performance and memory-efficiency, while also acknowledging the need for a broader assessment of non-functional requirements. The results suggest that ChatGPT is better than beginners at solving easy and medium prob-lems, but it is not yet proven to beat expert programmers. This paper posits that a comprehensive comparison of soft-ware engineers and AI-based solutions, considering various evaluation criteria, is pivotal in fostering human-machine collaboration, enhancing the reliability of AI-based meth-ods, and understanding task suitability for humans or AI. Furthermore, it facilitates the effective implementation of co-operative work structures and human-in-the-loop processes.},

abstract = {Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets that meet given natural language requirements and plays an important role in software development. Although Code LLMs have shown excellent performance in this domain, their long generation time poses a signification limitation in practice use. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth preliminary study with different Code LLMs on code generation task and identify a significant efficiency issue, i.e., continual generation of excess tokens. It harms the developer productivity and leads to huge computational wastes. To address it, we introduce CodeFast, an inference acceleration approach for Code LLMs on code generation. The key idea of CodeFast is to terminate the inference process in time when unnecessary excess tokens are detected. First, we propose an automatic data construction framework to obtain training data. Then, we train a unified lightweight model GenGuard applicable to multiple programming languages to predict whether to terminate inference at the current step. Finally, we enhance Code LLM with GenGuard to accelerate its inference in code generation task. We conduct extensive experiments with CodeFast on five representative Code LLMs across four widely used code generation datasets. Experimental results show that (1) CodeFast can significantly improve the inference speed of various Code LLMs in code generation, ranging form 34% to 452%, without compromising the quality of generated code. (2) CodeFast is stable across different parameter settings and can generalize to untrained datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CodeFast.},

However, it may be limited in creativity and depth. Generative AI models, while capable of covering broader topics and interpreting complex contexts, require more computational resources and may introduce inaccuracies in specialized domains. The PolyAQG framework offers scalability within specific domains and predictable error handling. Generative AI models, although scalable across topics, may require fine-tuning for accuracy. Furthermore, Generative AI enables dynamic user interaction and fosters critical thinking, while the PolyAQG framework provides a more limited user interface. The choice between PolyAQG and generative AI depends on application needs.

abstract = {With the popularity of generative AI, LLM inference has become one of the most popular cloud workloads. Modern popular LLMs have hundreds of billions of parameters and support very large input/output prompt token sizes (100K-1M). As a result, their computational state during LLM inference can exceed the memory available on GPUs. One solution to this GPU memory problem is to offload the model weights and KV cache to the host memory. As the size of the models and prompts continue to increase, researchers have started to explore the use of secondary storage, such as SSDs, to store the model weights and KV cache. However, there is a lack of study on the I/O characteristics and performance requirements of these offloading operations. In order to have a better understanding of the performance characteristics of these offloading operations, in this work, we collect, study, and characterize the block layer I/O traces from two LLM inference frameworks, DeepSpeed and FlexGen, that support model and KV cache offloading to SSDs. Through our analysis of these I/O traces, we report that: (i) libaio-based tensor offloading delivers higher I/O bandwidth for both writing and reading tensors to/from the SSDs than POSIX; (ii) the I/O workload of model offloading is dominated by 128 KiB reads for both DeepSpeed and FlexGen in the block layer; (iii) model offloading does not saturate NVMe SSDs; and (iv) the I/O workload of KV cache offloading contains both read and write workloads dominated by 128 KiB requests, but the average bandwidth of read is much higher than write (2.0 GiB/s vs. 11.0 MiB/s).

abstract = {The rapid growth in the usage and applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in various sociotechnical solutions has highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of bias and its impact on society. While research on bias in NLP has expanded, several challenges persist that require attention. These include the limited focus on sociodemographic biases beyond race and gender, the narrow scope of analysis predominantly centered on models, and the technocentric implementation approaches. This paper addresses these challenges and advocates for a more interdisciplinary approach to understanding bias in NLP. The work is structured into three facets, each exploring a specific aspect of bias in NLP. The first facet focuses on identifying sociodemographic bias in various NLP architectures, emphasizing the importance of considering both the models themselves and human computation to comprehensively understand and identify bias. In the second facet, we delve into the significance of establishing a shared vocabulary across different fields and disciplines involved in NLP. By highlighting the potential bias stemming from a lack of shared understanding, this facet emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge the gap and foster a more inclusive and accurate analysis of bias. Finally, the third facet investigates the development of a holistic solution by integrating frameworks from social science disciplines. This approach recognizes the complexity of bias in NLP and advocates for an interdisciplinary framework that goes beyond purely technical considerations, involving social and ethical perspectives to address bias effectively. The first facet includes the following of my published works [6, 7, 8, 9] to provide results into how the importance of understanding the presence of bias in various minority group that has not been in focus in the prior works of bias in NLP. The work also shows the need to create a method that considers both human and AI indicators of bias, showcasing the importance of the first facet of my research. In my study [9], I delve into sentiment analysis and toxicity detection models to identify explicit bias against race, gender, and people with disabilities (PWDs). Through statistical exploration of conversations on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, I gain insights into how disability bias permeates real-world social settings. To quantify explicit sociodemographic bias in sentiment analysis and toxicity analysis models, I create the Bias Identification Test in Sentiment (BITS) corpus1. Applying BITS, I uncover significant biases in popular AIaaS sentiment analysis tools, including TextBlob, VADER, and Google Cloud Natural Language API, as well as toxicity analysis models like Toxic-BERT. Remarkably, all of these models exhibit statistically significant explicit bias against disability, underscoring the need for comprehensive understanding and mitigation of biases affecting such groups. The work also demonstrates the utility of BITS as a model-independent method of identifying bias by focusing on social groups instead. Expanding on this, my next work [8] delves into the realm of implicit bias in NLP models. While some models may not overtly exhibit bias, they can unintentionally perpetuate harmful stereotypes [4]. To measure and identify implicit bias in commonly used embedding and large language models, I propose a methodology to measure social biases in various NLP architectures. Focusing on people with disabilities (PWD) as a group with complex social dynamics, I analyze various word embedding-based and transformer-based LLMs, revealing significant biases against PWDs in all tested models. These findings expose how models trained on extensive corpora tend to favor ableist language, underscoring the urgency of detecting and addressing implicit bias. The above two works look at both the implicit and explicit nature of bias in NLP, showcasing the need to distinguish the efforts placed in understanding them. The results also demonstrate the utility of identifying such biases as it provides context to the black-box nature of such public models. As the field of NLP evolved from embedding-based models to large language models, the way these models are constructed underwent significant changes [5]. However, the concern arises from the fact that these models often reflect a populist viewpoint [1] that perpetuates majority-held ideas rather than objective truths. This difference in perception can lead to biases perpetuated by the majority’s worldview. To explore this aspect, I investigate how LLMs represent nationality and their impact on societal stereotypes [6]. By examining LLM-generated stories for various nationalities, I establish a correlation between sentiment and the population of internet users in a country. The study reveals the unintentional implicit and explicit nationality biases exhibited by GPT-2, with nations having lower internet representation and economic status generating negative sentiment stories and employing a greater number of negative adjectives. Additionally, I explore potential debiasing methods such as adversarial triggering and prompt engineering, demonstrating their efficacy in mitigating stereotype propagation through LLM models. While prior work predominantly relies on automatic indicators like sentiment scores or vector distances to identify bias [3], the next phase of my research emphasizes the importance of understanding biases through the lens of human readers [7], bringing to light the need for a human lens in understanding bias through human-aided indicators and mixed-method identification. By incorporating concepts of social computation, using human evaluation, we gain a better understanding of biases’ potential societal impact within the context of language models. To achieve this, I conduct open-ended interviews and employ qualitative coding and thematic analysis to comprehend the implications of biases on human readers. The findings demonstrate that biased NLP models tend to replicate and amplify existing societal biases, posing potential harm when utilized in sociotechnical settings. The qualitative analysis from the interviews provides valuable insights into readers’ experiences when encountering biased articles, highlighting the capacity to shift a reader’s perception of a country. These findings emphasize the critical role of public perception in shaping AI’s impact on society and the need to correct biases in AI systems. The second facet of my research aims to bridge the disparity between AI research and society. This disparity has resulted in a lack of shared understanding between these domains, leading to potential biases and harm toward specific groups. Employing an interdisciplinary approach that combines social informatics, philosophy, and AI, I will investigate the similarities and disparities in the concepts utilized by machine learning models. Existing research [2] highlights the insufficient interdisciplinary effort and motivation in comprehending social aspects of NLP. To commence this exploration, I will delve into the shared taxonomy of sentiment and fairness in natural language processing, sociology, and humanities. This research will first delve into the interdisciplinary nature of sentiment and its application in sentiment analysis models. Sentiment analysis, a popular machine learning application for text classification based on sentiment, opinion, and subjectivity, holds significant influence as a sociotechnical system that impacts both social and technical actors within a network. Nevertheless, the definition and connotation of sentiment vary vastly across different research fields, potentially leading to misconceptions regarding the utility of such systems. To address this issue, this study will examine how diverse fields, including psychology, sociology, and technology, define the concept of sentiment. By unraveling the divergent perspectives on sentiment within different fields, the paper will uncover discrepancies and varying applications of this interdisciplinary concept. Additionally, the research will survey commonly utilized sentiment analysis models, aiming to comprehend their standardized definitions and associated issues. Ultimately, the study will pose critical questions that should be considered during the development of social models to mitigate potential biases and harm stemming from an insufficiently defined comprehension of fundamental social concepts. Similar efforts will be dedicated to comprehending the disparity in bias and fairness as an interdisciplinary concept, shedding light on the imperative for inclusive research to cultivate superior AI models as sociotechnical solutions. The third facet of my study embarks upon an exploration of the intricate interplay between human and AI actors, employing the formidable theoretical lens of actor-network theory (ANT). Through the presentation of a robust framework, this facet aims to engender the formation of efficacious development networks that foster collaboration among developers, practitioners, and other essential stakeholders. Such inclusive networks serve as crucibles for the cultivation of holistic solutions that transcend the discriminatory trappings afflicting specific populations. A tangible outcome of this endeavor entails the creation of an all-encompassing bias analysis platform, poised to guide the discernment and amelioration of an array of sociodemographic biases manifesting within any machine-learning system. By catalyzing the development of socially aware and less pernicious technology, this research makes a substantial contribution to the realms of NLP and AI. The significance of this proposed research reverberates beyond the confines of NLP, resonating throughout the broader domain of AI, wherein analogous challenges about social biases loom large. Leveraging the proposed framework, developers, practitioners, and policymakers are empowered to forge practical solutions that embody inclusivity and reliability, especially when used as a service (AIaaS). Moreover, the platform serves as a centralized locus for the identification and rectification of social biases, irrespective of the underlying model or architecture. By furnishing a cogent narrative that underscores the imperative for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, my work strives to propel the ongoing endeavors to comprehend and mitigate biases within the realm of NLP. With its potential to augment the equity, inclusivity, and societal ramifications of NLP technologies, the proposed framework catapults the field towards responsible and ethical practices.},

abstract = {Training of large-scale deep learning models necessitates parallelizing the model and data across numerous devices, and the choice of parallelism strategy substantially depends on the training workloads such as memory consumption, computation cost, and communication cost. Current approaches generally assume uniform training workloads across samples in a given task. Thus, existing systems are designed to adopt a static parallelism strategy throughout one training process. Nevertheless, when training models with sequence inputs, this assumption fails due to the sequence length variation across samples. Consequently, training with a static parallelism strategy would result in sub-optimal performance.In this paper, we first reveal the under-explored fact that the optimal parallelism strategy varies even for the sequences within a single mini-batch. Motivated by this, we present HotSPa, a novel system that adopts multiple parallelism strategies for efficient training with sequence inputs. To be specific, given a mini-batch of training sequences, HotSPa partitions them into multiple groups and applies different parallelism strategies to process each group individually. To enable the hot switching between strategies, HotSPa transfers model parameters and accumulated gradients among the devices on the fly. Significant solutions are proposed with the hope of seamless and rapid parallelism hot switching. Firstly, we design a graph compiler, which generates distributed computation graphs for different parallelism strategies simultaneously, and orchestrates them to share a single model storage backbone. Secondly, we develop a simple yet effective hot switch planner, which heuristically deduces communication plans to accelerate the transition of model partitioning given any pairs of strategies. Extensive experiments on large language model training demonstrate that HotSPa can be up to 2.99\texttimes{} faster than Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed that utilize static parallelism strategies.

abstract = {Modern society is facing pressing issues, including environmental challenges, inequality, and regional conflicts. To resolve these complex societal problems, the concept of ''open science'' is essential, as emphasized at last year's G7 meeting. In Japan, starting in 2025, all scientific papers resulting from publicly funded research, along with the associated data, will be required to be immediately accessible through open access.The National Institute of Informatics (NII) has been at the forefront of advancing Japan's academic information infrastructure for many years. In 2017, NII embarked on the development of the NII Research Data Cloud -- a platform for the publication, discovery, and management of academic information -- which became operational in 2021. By 2022, the project evolved into a research data ecosystem, built in collaboration with numerous universities and research institutions. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive environment where papers, data, and computational resources are readily accessible across all fields of research.Recognizing the significant impact of generative AI on society and the need for a hub in Japan where large-scale language models (LLMs) can be developed and studied, NII spearheaded the formation of the LLM-jp study group (https://llm-jp.nii.ac.jp/en/) in May 2023. The group, founded on principles of openness, began with approximately 30 researchers specializing in natural language processing and has since grown to over 1,800 participants from industry, government, and academia.In April 2024, NII further advanced this initiative by establishing the LLM R&amp;D Center. By September 2024, the center had developed and released the world's largest fully open LLM, featuring 172 billion parameters -- on a scale similar to GPT-3.5. The center's ongoing work also focuses on ensuring the reliability and transparency of these models. To address the complex societal challenges mentioned above, it is crucial not only to deepen academic research but also to foster collaboration across various disciplines, creating new cross-disciplinary knowledge. LLMs can play a pivotal role in these processes by interpreting data, interconnecting and systematizing knowledge, and laying the groundwork for a robust knowledge infrastructure.},

These interactive diagrams are seamlessly integrated into scanned textbook pages, facilitating interactive and personalized learning experiences across various physics concepts, such as optics, circuits, and kinematics. Drawing from an elicitation study with seven physics instructors, we explore four key augmentation strategies: 1) augmented experiments, 2) animated diagrams, 3) bi-directional binding, and 4) parameter visualization. We evaluate our system through technical evaluation, a usability study (N=12), and expert interviews (N=12). Study findings suggest that our system can facilitate more engaging and personalized learning experiences in physics education.},

abstract = {Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide range of tasks such as question answering and code generation.  
On a high level, given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between the language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which may still require ad-hoc interaction.  

Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP). LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy adaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providing high-level semantics.  

To enable LMP, we implement LMQL (short for Language Model Query Language), which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls to the underlying language model.  

We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case of pay-to-use APIs (26-85% cost savings).},

abstract = {Cloud systems have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their flexibility and scalability. Each time cloud computing applications and services hosted on the cloud are affected by a cloud outage, users can experience slow response times, connection issues or total service disruption, resulting in a significant negative business impact. Outages are usually comprised of several concurring events/source causes, and therefore understanding the context of outages is a very challenging yet crucial first step toward mitigating and resolving outages. In current practice, on-call engineers with in-depth domain knowledge, have to manually assess and summarize outages when they happen, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we first present a large-scale empirical study investigating the way on-call engineers currently deal with cloud outages at Microsoft, and then present and empirically validate a novel approach (dubbed Oasis) to help the engineers in this task. Oasis is able to automatically assess the impact scope of outages as well as to produce human-readable summarization. Specifically, Oasis first assesses the impact scope of an outage by aggregating relevant incidents via multiple techniques. Then, it generates a human-readable summary by leveraging fine-tuned large language models like GPT-3.x. The impact assessment component of Oasis was introduced in Microsoft over three years ago, and it is now widely adopted, while the outage summarization component has been recently introduced, and in this article we present the results of an empirical evaluation we carried out on 18 real-world cloud systems as well as a human-based evaluation with outage owners. The results obtained show that Oasis can effectively and efficiently summarize outages, and lead Microsoft to deploy its first prototype which is currently under experimental adoption by some of the incident teams.},

abstract = {This study examined 120 Turkish stories written for primary, secondary, high school, and undergraduate education levels by ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini1.5 Pro. The data was processed by software created with Natural Language Processing methods in mind. The general characteristics, quantitative characteristics, and readability of the stories were all reviewed within the scope of the study. Using the Ate\c{s}man and Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formulas, which are widely used for Turkish texts, the readability of the stories was calculated. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that AI is able to produce distinct stories, and it generates cohesive stories by utilizing subjects and themes that are suitable for a specific educational audience. When the average readabilities are taken into account, it has been found that ChatGPT-3.5 generates better stories suited for the education level based on the Ate\c{s}man formula and Gemini based on the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula, and the difficulty level of ChatGPT-3.5 stories rises in tandem with education level in both formulas. Also, the stories at the undergraduate level were found to be the hardest to read and with primary schools having the easiest readability. When the number of stories at readability levels is taken into account, it has been found that GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 in the Ate\c{s}man formula and ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini in the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula generate appropriate stories for the education level; the levels range from easy to difficult as the education level increases. Additionally, it has been found that the number of stories included is gradually increasing. It was concluded that AIs produced stories above their educational level; while ChatGPT-3.5 and Gemini were more successful in story production, the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula was better in determining readability.},

abstract = {With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, traditional Transformer-based models (such as LLaMA 3) face challenges in resource-constrained environments due to their huge parameter size and computational complexity. To improve efficiency, model compression has become an important research direction. This paper proposes an innovative knowledge distillation strategy to distill the LlamaDecoderLayer of LLaMA 3 into a smaller student model TinyDecoder to reduce the computational and storage overhead of the model. TinyDecoder significantly reduces the model size and computational complexity while maintaining good performance by simplifying parameters such as the hidden layer size and the number of attention heads in LlamaDecoderLayer. Experimental results show that the distilled model significantly reduces storage requirements and computational load while still achieving decent performance. The parameter size of the distilled model is about 4.3% of the original model, the throughput speedup ratio is 1.49x - 10.93x, and the perplexity only increases from 3.25 to 7.94. Although the text generation performance of the distilled model has declined, the inference speed and memory usage are significantly improved compared to the original model, which is particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments. Through distillation, the student model effectively learns the core knowledge of the teacher model and performs well on tasks of simple to medium complexity.},

abstract = {As we entered the 21st century, with the development of computers and mobile internet, research in Artificial Intelligence has made significant advancements. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of science and engineering focused on enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses various subfields such as machine learning, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer vision. In 2022, OpenAI released a new chatbot model named ChatGPT, which can understand human language and generate text like a human. Its robust data capabilities have attracted the attention of experts in various fields. However, the public's perception and attitude towards AI technology and ChatGPT are also crucial. Therefore, in this study, we used an online experiment and employed different groups of ChatGPT-generated content recommendation and real-person-generated content recommendation as experimental manipulation conditions. From the user perception perspective, we aimed to explore the differences between user perceptions of content recommendation provided by Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT) and those provided by real-person. We also investigated whether the perception of AI-generated (ChatGPT) content recommendation had an impact on users' subsequent intention to support Ant Forest Game. The results show significant differences in perceived content quality between AI-generated (ChatGPT) Ant Forest Game content recommendation and real-person-generated content recommendation. Additionally, in terms of subsequent support intention for Ant Forest Game, there were also significant differences between AI-generated (ChatGPT) Ant Forest Game content recommendation and real-person generated Ant Forest Game content recommendation. Ant Forest Game content recommendation was found to significantly enhance Ant Forest Game support intention. Participants exhibited higher perceived content quality and greater support intention for AI-generated (ChatGPT) Ant Forest Game content recommendation. This study explores the psychological mechanisms involved in human-computer interaction, contributing to research in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Compared to a real human person's recommendation, people tend to prefer ChatGPT's recommendation, showing that people exhibit similar social behaviors and emotional responses when interacting with generative AI (ChatGPT) as they do with real humans. These findings are significant for the development and improvement of Artificial Intelligence.},

Combined with hardware technology advances, CarbonMin can keep emissions increase to only 20% compared to 2022 levels for 55x greater workload.

abstract = {With the rapid advances in deep learning, we have witnessed a strongly increased interest in conversational recommender systems (CRS). Until recently, however, even the latest generative models exhibited major limitations and they frequently return non-meaningful responses according to previous studies. However, with the latest Generative AI-based dialog systems implemented with Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models, a new era has arrived for CRS research. In this work, we study the use of ChatGPT as a movie recommender system. To this purpose, we conducted an online user study involving N=190 participants, who were tasked to evaluate ChatGPT’s responses in a multitude of dialog situations. As a reference point for the analysis, we included a retrieval-based conversational method in the experiment, which was found to be a robust approach in previous research. Our study results indicate that the responses by ChatGPT were perceived to be significantly better than those by the previous system in terms of their meaningfulness. A detailed inspection of the results showed that ChatGPT excelled when providing recommendations, but sometimes missed the context when asked questions about a movie within a longer dialog. A statistical analysis revealed that information adequacy and recommendation accuracy of the responses had the strongest influence on the perceived meaningfulness of the responses. Finally, an additional analysis showed that the human perceptions of meaningfulness correlated only very weakly with computational metrics such as BLEU or ROUGE, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the evaluation of a CRS.},

abstract = {ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has attracted significant attention from early adopters. While this generative artificial intelligence (AI) system can be somewhat intuitive, such technology can also be disruptive in domains that require creativity (e.g., computer coding, system development and education), information authenticity (e.g., news agencies) and precision (e.g., manufacturing, clinical decision making). This study urges scholars in the fields of human-computer interaction and information system to reexamine technology adoption to better understand the criticality and ethics of AI and ChatGPT with regards to social change and social impact.},

abstract = {Abstract: Increased use of generative artificial intelligence or AI in various academic activities such as programming is a significant milestone in technology diffusion in learning. To bring AI closer to how programmers think, behave, and interact, it is imperative for research to establish a clear connection between various human factors that lead to its adoption. Using a model based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we positioned human traits of academic stress, risk propensity, neuroticism, and computer self-efficacy as factors that positively influence attitudes toward the use of AI in programming among university students. We further posited that attitude and social norms lead to the behavioral intention to use AI in programming. We used PLS-SEM to analyze responses from 131 programming students who use ChatGPT to accomplish learning tasks. We found that both academic stress and computer self-efficacy influence attitudes toward using AI in programming. While attitude positively influences the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, we found that risk propensity and neuroticism do not affect attitude, and social norms do not influence behavioral intention. We discuss the implications of our investigation to the industry and the academe.},

abstract = {Identifying the misconceptions of novice programmers is pertinent for informing instructors of the challenges faced by their students in learning computer programming. In the current literature, custom tools, test scripts were developed and, in most cases, manual effort to go through the individual codes were required to identify and categorize the errors latent within the students' code submissions. This entails investment of substantial effort and time from the instructors. In this study, we thus propose the use of ChatGPT in identifying and categorizing the errors. Using prompts that were seeded only with the student's code and the model code solution for questions from two lab tests, we were able to leverage on ChatGPT's natural language processing and knowledge representation capabilities to automatically collate frequencies of occurrence of the errors by error types. We then clustered the generated error descriptions for further insights into the misconceptions of the students. The results showed that although ChatGPT was not able to identify the errors perfectly, the achieved accuracy of 93.3% is sufficiently high for instructors to have an aggregated picture of the common errors of their students. To conclude, we have proposed a method for instructors to automatically collate the errors latent within the students' code submissions using ChatGPT. Notably, with the novel use of generated error descriptions, the instructors were able to have a more granular view of the misconceptions of their students, without the onerous effort of manually going through the students' codes.},

abstract = {The enhance of accuracy in reasoning results of LLMs arouses the community's interests, wherein pioneering studies investigate post-hoc strategies to rectify potential mistakes. Despite extensive efforts, they are all stuck in a state of resource competition demand ing significant time and computing expenses. The cause of the situation lies in the failure of identifying the fundamental feature of the solutions in this line, coined as the self-denial of LLMs. In other words, LLMs should confidently determine the potential existence of mistakes and carefully execute the targeted correction. As the whole procedure conducts within LLMs, supporting and persuasive references are hard to acquire, while the absence of specific steps towards refining hidden mistakes persists even when errors are acknowledged. In response to the challenges, we present PSSD, which refers to and implements the human psyche structure such that three distinct and interconnected roles contribute to human reasoning. Specifically, PSSD leverages the recent multi-agent paradigm, and is further enhanced with three innovatively conceived roles: (1) the intuition-based id role that provides initial attempts based on benign LLMs; (2) the rule-driven superego role that summarizes rules to regulate the above attempts, and returns specific key points as guidance; and (3) the script-centric ego role that absorbs all procedural information to generate executable script for the final answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design not only better enhance reasoning capabilities, but also seamlessly integrate with current models, leading to superior performance.},

abstract = {In response to innovations in machine learning (ML) models, production workloads changed radically and rapidly. TPU v4 is the fifth Google domain specific architecture (DSA) and its third supercomputer for such ML models. Optical circuit switches (OCSes) dynamically reconfigure its interconnect topology to improve scale, availability, utilization, modularity, deployment, security, power, and performance; users can pick a twisted 3D torus topology if desired. Much cheaper, lower power, and faster than Infiniband, OCSes and underlying optical components are &lt;5% of system cost and &lt;3% of system power. Each TPU v4 includes SparseCores, dataflow processors that accelerate models that rely on embeddings by 5x--7x yet use only 5% of die area and power. Deployed since 2020, TPU v4 outperforms TPU v3 by 2.1x and improves performance/Watt by 2.7x. The TPU v4 supercomputer is 4x larger at 4096 chips and thus nearly 10x faster overall, which along with OCS flexibility and availability allows a large language model to train at an average of ~60% of peak FLOPS/second. For similar sized systems, it is ~4.3x--4.5x faster than the Graphcore IPU Bow and is 1.2x--1.7x faster and uses 1.3x--1.9x less power than the Nvidia A100. TPU v4s inside the energy-optimized warehouse scale computers of Google Cloud use ~2--6x less energy and produce ~20x less CO2e than contemporary DSAs in typical on-premise data centers.},

abstract = {Deep learning has achieved great success in numerous application areas at the cost of high computational complexity. To meet the ever-increasing computational demand, commodity hardware platforms (e.g., CPUs and GPUs) offer abundant computing resources including scalar, vector, and tensor units for deep learning that could execute in parallel. However, existing top-down tiling-based deep learning compilers often generate a homogeneous mapping from the given tensor computation task to hardware arithmetic instructions, failing to utilize different computing units simultaneously to achieve higher performance.In this paper, we propose Mosaic, a bottom-up tessellation-based deep learning compiler that directly tessellates the given tensor computation task with varying instructions, forming a heterogeneous instruction-to-task mapping to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP) across different computing units. The key that enables such tessellation is the iTex abstraction, which models the relationship between the instruction operations and its semantics with formalized affine functions. Based on the iTex, we propose a heuristic approach to efficiently generate various tessellation plans. Further, we propose the iTex scheduling technique to orchestrate the execution of instructions, reducing potential structural hazards and maximizing the exploitable ILP. Our extensive evaluation shows that Mosaic achieves an average speedup ranging from 1.08\texttimes{} to 1.28\texttimes{} across multiple hardware platforms compared to highly optimized vendor libraries. Mosaic also achieves an average speedup of 1.34\texttimes{} over the best existing baselines on real-world operators extracted from LLMs. More importantly, Mosaic reaches up to 106% of the GPU Tensor Core theoretical peak throughput, demonstrating its effective exploitation of ILP.},

abstract = {Over the past year (2022–2023), recently-released AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have gained significant attention from computing educators. Both researchers and practitioners have discovered that these tools can generate correct solutions to a variety of introductory programming assignments and accurately explain the contents of code. Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs. Our study findings capture a rare snapshot in time in early 2023 as computing instructors are just starting to form opinions about this fast-growing phenomenon but have not yet converged to any consensus about best practices. Using these findings as inspiration, we synthesized a diverse set of open research questions regarding how to develop, deploy, and evaluate AI coding tools for computing education.},

abstract = {Large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot learning generalization capabilities for new language tasks. However, applying LLMs to the image captioning problem still poses challenges. This is primarily due to the modality gap between image captioning and LLMs. Existing methods address the modality gap by training language and visual models end-to-end, but this approach incurs significant computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines multiple caption generation and fusion of image captions, providing cues for decoupling the modalities and tasks of image captioning from LLMs without the need for end-to-end training. Specifically, we generate multiple captions, relevant questions, and their answers for each image. Then, using prompt templates, we input this information into a large-scale pre-trained language model to generate captions. This approach offers several benefits: Flexibility: It allows for the flexible use of various LLMs to perform the image captioning task. Cost Efficiency: By avoiding end-to-end training, significantly reduces the computational costs of zero-shot learning with LLMs. Performance Improvement: Our proposed method outperforms previous approaches, demonstrating enhanced performance in generating image captions. By adopting this approach, we aim to bridge the gap between LLMs and the image captioning task, providing a cost-effective solution that achieves improved performance without the need for resource-intensive end-to-end training.},

abstract = {Generative AI, exemplified in ChatGPT, Dall-E 2, and Stable Diffusion, are exciting new applications consuming growing quantities of computing. We study the compute, energy, and carbon impacts of generative AI inference. Using ChatGPT as an exemplar, we create a workload model and compare request direction approaches (Local, Balance, CarbonMin), assessing their power use and carbon impacts.Our workload model shows that for ChatGPT-like services, inference dominates emissions, in one year producing 25x the carbon-emissions of training GPT-3. The workload model characterizes user experience, and experiments show that carbon emissions-aware algorithms (CarbonMin) can both maintain user experience and reduce carbon emissions dramatically (35%). We also consider a future scenario (2035 workload and power grids), and show that CarbonMin can reduce emissions by 56%. In both cases, the key is intelligent direction of requests to locations with low-carbon power. Combined with hardware technology advances, CarbonMin can keep emissions increase to only 20% compared to 2022 levels for 55x greater workload. Finally we consider datacenter headroom to increase effectiveness of shifting. With headroom, CarbonMin reduces 2035 emissions by 71%.},

This work proposes six adaptable, reproducible pedagogical metrics. With these metrics, we track an Introductory CS course's capstone projects, 2018--2024. The results suggest both year-over-year evolution and a more sudden, LLM-correlated impact on students' relationship with their early computing work. We have begun adapting our curriculum to these signals, and we foresee future refinements and broader applications to metrics-based reproducible curricular assessment.},

abstract = {The rise of microarchitectural attacks has necessitated robust detection and mitigation strategies to secure computing systems. Traditional tools, such as static and dynamic code analyzers and attack detectors, often fall short due to their reliance on predefined patterns and heuristics that lack the flexibility to adapt to new or evolving attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a microarchitecture security assistant, built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5, which we refer to as μLAM. This assistant surpasses conventional tools by not only identifying vulnerable code segments but also providing context-aware mitigations, tailored to specific system specifications and existing security measures. Additionally, μLAM leverages real-time data from dynamic Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) and system specifications to detect ongoing attacks, offering a level of adaptability and responsiveness that static and dynamic analyzers cannot match.For fine-tuning μLAM, we utilize a comprehensive dataset that includes system configurations, mitigations already in place for different generations of systems, dynamic HPC values, and both vulnerable and non-vulnerable source codes. This rich dataset enables μLAM to harness its advanced LLM natural language processing capabilities to understand and interpret complex code patterns and system behaviors, learning continuously from new data to improve its predictive accuracy and respond effectively in real time to both known and novel threats, making it an indispensable tool against microarchitectural threats. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of μLAM by fine-tuning and testing it on code utilizing well-known cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL, Libgcrypt, and NaCl, thereby illustrating its effectiveness in securing critical and complex software environments.},

To what degree can these tools align with developer workflows, and what new modes of human-computer interaction can emerge from their use? We present DreamGarden, an AI system capable of assisting with the development of diverse game environments in Unreal Engine. At the core of our method is an LLM-driven planner, capable of breaking down a single, high-level prompt—a dream, memory, or imagined scenario provided by a human user—into a hierarchical action plan, which is then distributed across specialized submodules facilitating concrete implementation. This system is presented to the user as a garden of plans and actions, both growing independently and responding to user intervention via seed prompts, pruning, and feedback. Through a user study, we explore design implications of this system, charting courses for future work in semi-autonomous assistants and open-ended simulation design.},

abstract = {We propose a novel zero-shot approach to computing correspondences between 3D shapes. Existing approaches mainly focus on isometric and near-isometric shape pairs (e.g., human vs. human), but less attention has been given to strongly non-isometric and inter-class shape matching (e.g., human vs. cow). To this end, we introduce a fully automatic method that exploits the exceptional reasoning capabilities of recent foundation models in language and vision to tackle difficult shape correspondence problems. Our approach comprises multiple stages. First, we classify the 3D shapes in a zero-shot manner by feeding rendered shape views to a language-vision model (e.g., BLIP2) to generate a list of class proposals per shape. These proposals are unified into a single class per shape by employing the reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT. Second, we attempt to segment the two shapes in a zero-shot manner, but in contrast to the co-segmentation problem, we do not require a mutual set of semantic regions. Instead, we propose to exploit the in-context learning capabilities of ChatGPT to generate two different sets of semantic regions for each shape and a semantic mapping between them. This enables our approach to match strongly non-isometric shapes with significant differences in geometric structure. Finally, we employ the generated semantic mapping to produce coarse correspondences that can further be refined by the functional maps framework to produce dense point-to-point maps. Our approach, despite its simplicity, produces highly plausible results in a zero-shot manner, especially between strongly non-isometric shapes.},

abstract = {ChatGPT OpenAI, a large-language chatbot model, has gained a lot of attention due to its popularity and impressive performance in many natural language processing tasks. ChatGPT produces superior answers to a wide range of real-world human questions and generates human-like text. The new OpenAI ChatGPT technology may have some strengths and weaknesses at this early stage. Users have reported early opinions about the ChatGPT features, and their feedback is essential to recognize and fix its shortcomings and issues. This study uses the ChatGPT tweets Arabic dataset to automatically find user opinions and sentiments about ChatGPT technology. The dataset is preprocessed and labeled using the TextBlob Arabic Python library into positive, negative, and neutral tweets. Despite extensive works for the English language, languages like Arabic are less studied regarding tweet analysis. Existing literature about Arabic tweet sentiment analysis has mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning models. We collected a total of 27,780 unstructured tweets from Twitter using the Tweepy SNscrape Python library using various hash-tags such as # Chat-GPT, #OpenAI, #Chatbot, Chat-GPT3, and so on. To enhance the model’s performance and reduce computational complexity, unstructured tweets are converted into structured and normalized forms. Tweets contain missing values, URL and HTML tags, stop words, punctuation, diacritics, elongations, and numeric values that have no impact on the model performance; hence, these increase the computational cost. So, these steps are removed with the help of Python preprocessing libraries to enhance text quality and consistency. This study adopts Transformer-based models such as RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT that automatically classify the tweets. Additionally, a hybrid transformer-based model is proposed to obtain better results. The proposed hybrid model is developed by combining the hidden outputs of the RoBERTA and BERT models using a concatenation layer, then adding dense layers with “Relu” activation employed as a hidden layer to create non-linearity and a “softmax” activation function for multiclass classification. They differ from existing state-of-the-art models due to the enhanced capabilities of both models in text classification. Hybrid models combine the different models to make accurate predictions and reduce bias and enhanced the overall results, while state-of-the-art models are incapable of making accurate predictions. Experiments show that the proposed hybrid model achieves 96.02% accuracy, 100% precision on negative tweets, and 99% recall for neutral tweets. The performance of the proposed model is far better than existing state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Efficiently reviewing scholarly literature and synthesizing prior art are crucial for scientific progress. Yet, the growing scale of publications and the burden of knowledge make synthesis of research threads more challenging than ever.While significant research has been devoted to helping scholars interact with individual papers, building research threads scattered across multiple papers remains a challenge.Most top-down synthesis (and LLMs) make it difficult to personalize and iterate on the output, while bottom-up synthesis is costly in time and effort.Here, we explore a new design space of mixed-initiative workflows.In doing so we develop a novel computational pipeline, Synergi, that ties together user input of relevant seed threads with citation graphs and LLMs, to expand and structure them, respectively.Synergiallows scholars to start with an entire threads-and-subthreads structure generated from papers relevant to their interests, and to iterate and customize on it as they wish. In our evaluation, we find that Synergi helps scholars efficiently make sense of relevant threads, broaden their perspectives, and increases their curiosity. We discuss future design implications for thread-based, mixed-initiative scholarly synthesis support tools.},

abstract = {A nudge is a concept from Behavioral Economics and Psychology that refers to any small change or intervention designed to influence people's behavior predictably, without restricting their options or significantly altering their incentives. The research follows the Design Science Research methodology, introducing Nudge Evidence Briefing (NEB) to facilitate the understanding, access, application of academic findings on nudges for non-academic professionals, considering the gap between academic research on nudges and their practical application. Leveraging insights from the Evidence-Based Medicine framework, NEBs distill key findings from primary research into concise, accessible documents. Through a systematic review of the literature on nudge integration into software privacy and security, 12 primary studies were selected and the data extracted from them was formatted into NEBs. Participants, specialists and non-specialists, were invited to evaluate the NEB through online questionnaires. Feedback highlighted the clarity and structured format of the NEB, with particular praise for its ability to communicate complex scientific evidence in an accessible way. Overall, the NEB demonstrates significant promise in making nudge-related research more accessible and feasible. Ongoing refinements based on participant feedback will be crucial to realizing its full potential, contributing to the advancement of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the practical application of nudges in professional environments. Future work will focus on evaluating the practical applicability of the NEB with non-academic professionals, exploring more reliable alternatives for generating NEBs through LLM, and developing a comprehensive repository of NEBs.},

abstract = {This paper presents "AI N\"{u}shu," an emerging language system inspired by N\"{u}shu (women's scripts), the unique language created and used exclusively by ancient Chinese women who were illiterate under a patriarchy society. Through an interactive art installation, two artificial intelligent (AI) agents continuously observe their environment and communicate with each other, developing a writing system that encodes Chinese. In this system, two AI agents observe the environment through cameras, record the unconscious behaviors of the audience, and generate summaries of their observations through visual recognition. Subsequently, the agent associates the corresponding original N\"{u}shu poetry lines and generates new poetry text through a Language Model (LLM), representing its reflection. To develop their language, they continuously switch roles between the speaker and listener, constantly communicating their reflections, and encrypting a word in the poetry line with their self-created AI N\"{u}shu character, allowing the other to guess and learn. Gradually, they reach a consensus on AI N\"{u}shu, forming a unique "AI N\"{u}shu Dictionary" for machines. This language, algorithmically combined into corresponding characters, has components derived from N\"{u}shu, similar to Chinese characters and traditional textile patterns. Thus, like ancient women, the two agents gradually developed their Chinese writing system, corresponding one-to-one with Chinese characters. In contrast, humans, as the authority of the language system, became an object observed, interpreted, and inspired by machines to stimulate non-human language. This is the first media art project to interpret N\"{u}shu from a computational linguistics perspective, infusing AI and art research with non-English natural language processing, Chinese cultural heritage, and a feminist viewpoint. This encourages the creation of more non-English, linguistically-oriented artworks for diverse cultures. We simulate communication in sisterhood through a multi-agent learning system, which questioned knowledge authority between humans and machines through the lens of language development.},
