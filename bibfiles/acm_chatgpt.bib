abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into software engineering and computer science education, it is crucial to understand their impact on student learning. While recent research has explored student perceptions of generative AI, little is known about how these tools influence students’ cognitive processes during programming tasks, such as code comprehension, a valuable skill in software development and maintenance. This paper presents the design of a study that aims to investigate how computer science students interact with LLMs, such as Google’s Gemini, in the context of code summarization using eye-tracking. This study will examine differences in visual attention, fixation behaviors, and performance of students engaged in code summarization with and without AI assistance across varying experience levels.},

abstract = {Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system.To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s).We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.},

abstract = {Software testing is a challenging topic in software engineering education and requires creative approaches to engage learners. For example, the Code Defenders game has students compete over a Java class under test by writing effective tests and mutants. While such gamified approaches deal with problems of motivation and engagement, students may nevertheless require help to put testing concepts into practice. The recent widespread diffusion of Generative AI and Large Language Models raises the question of whether and how these disruptive technologies could address this problem, for example, by providing explanations of unclear topics and guidance for writing tests. However, such technologies might also be misused or produce inaccurate answers, which would negatively impact learning. To shed more light on this situation, we conducted the first empirical study investigating how students learn and practice new software testing concepts in the context of the Code Defenders testing game, supported by a smart assistant based on a widely known, commercial Large Language Model. Our study shows that students had unrealistic expectations about the smart assistant, “blindly” trusting any output it generated, and often trying to use it to obtain solutions for testing exercises directly. Consequently, students who resorted to the smart assistant more often were less effective and efficient than those who did not. For instance, they wrote 8.6% fewer tests, and their tests were not useful in 78.0% of the cases. We conclude that giving unrestricted and unguided access to Large Language Models might generally impair learning. Thus, we believe our study helps to raise awareness about the implications of using Generative AI and Large Language Models in Computer Science Education and provides guidance towards developing better and smarter learning tools.},

This study explores the implementation of AI-Lab, a framework designed to guide students in the effective and ethical use of generative AI, in this case ChatGPT, in academic settings without compromising skill development. Conducted during Spring 2024, our use of the intervention targeted over 500 Computer Science and Data Science majors enrolled in their major-specific Data Structures and Algorithms courses. The AI-Lab framework enabled students to develop both conceptual questions and c++ and Python programs by interacting with ChatGPT and iteratively correcting its errors. Focus groups and post-intervention surveys revealed a generally positive experience. Students appreciated the ability to leverage AI for tasks outside their major, recognizing the value of understanding correct solutions through AI-assisted programming. Moreover, the guided use of generative AI by professors alleviated concerns regarding academic dishonesty, fostering a supportive learning environment. Despite these benefits, students expressed awareness of the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on AI, noting the risk of impeding their professional growth. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the practical utility of AI for non-major related tasks. This study highlights the importance of incorporating structured AI training in curricula to balance skill development and ethical AI usage, offering insights for broader applications in higher education.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

LLMs such as GPT expand their applications, from content creation to advanced code completion. They offer unmatched opportunities but pose unique challenges to the software engineering domain. This paper discusses the necessity and urgency for software engineering education to adapt and evolve to prepare software engineers for the emerging LLM environment. While existing literature and social media have investigated AI's integration into various educational spheres, there is a conspicuous gap in examining the specifics of LLMs' implications for software engineering education. We explore the goals of software engineering education, and changes to software engineering, software engineering education, course pedagogy, and ethics. We argue that a holistic approach is needed, combining technical skills, ethical awareness, and adaptable learning strategies. This paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing conversation about the future of software engineering education, emphasizing the importance of adapting and evolving to remain in sync with rapid advancements in AI and LLMs. It is hoped that this exploration will provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers in software engineering.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically generative AI (GenAI) are threatening to fundamentally reshape computing and society. Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving.There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms.},

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

abstract = {There is a great need for data in computing education research. Data is needed to understand how students behave, to train models of student behavior to optimally support students, and to develop and validate new assessment tools and learning analytics techniques. However, relatively few computing education datasets are shared openly, often due to privacy regulations and issues in making sure the data is anonymous. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to create large-scale, privacy-preserving synthetic data, which can be used to explore various aspects of student learning, develop and test educational technologies, and support research in areas where collecting real student data may be challenging or impractical. This work explores generating synthetic buggy code submissions for introductory programming exercises using GPT-4o. We compare the distribution of test case failures between synthetic and real student data from two courses to analyze the accuracy of the synthetic data in mimicking real student data. Our findings suggest that LLMs can be used to generate synthetic incorrect submissions that are not significantly different from real student data with regard to test case failure distributions. Our research contributes to the development of reliable synthetic datasets for computing education research and teaching, potentially accelerating progress in the field while preserving student privacy.},

A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

abstract = {There is a constant need for educators to develop and maintain effective up-to-date assessments. While there is a growing body of research in computing education on utilizing large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) in generation and engagement with coding exercises, the use of LLMs for generating programming MCQs has not been extensively explored. We analyzed the capability of GPT-4 to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) aligned with specific learning objectives (LOs) from Python programming classes in higher education. Specifically, we developed an LLM-powered (GPT-4) system for generation of MCQs from high-level course context and module-level LOs. We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be well-aligned with the LOs. Our findings can be leveraged by educators wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support MCQ authoring efforts.},

abstract = {The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.},

abstract = {Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized learning in computing education is promising, yet cloud-based LLMs pose risks around data security and privacy. To address these concerns, we developed and deployed a locally stored Small Language Model (SLM) utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. Previous work has demonstrated that SLMs can match or surpass popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) in handling conversational data from a CS1 course. We deployed SLMs with RAG (SLM + RAG) in a large course with more than 250 active students, fielding nearly 2,000 student questions, while evaluating data privacy, scalability, and feasibility of local deployments. This paper provides a comprehensive guide for deploying SLM + RAG systems, detailing model selection, vector database choice, embedding methods, and pipeline frameworks. We share practical insights from our deployment, including scalability concerns, accuracy versus context length trade-offs, guardrails and hallucination reduction, as well as data privacy maintenance. We address the "Impossible Triangle" in RAG systems, which states that achieving high accuracy, short context length, and low time consumption simultaneously is not feasible. Furthermore, our novel RAG framework, Intelligence Concentration (IC), categorizes information into multiple layers of abstraction within Milvus collections mitigating trade-offs and enabling educational assistants to deliver more relevant and personalized responses to students quickly.},

abstract = {The sudden emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has had a disruptive impact throughout the computing education community. LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages—for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with n = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students’ time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.},

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical aspect of learning and problem-solving for computing students. Recent research has shown that many students are aware of generative AI (GenAI) tools; however, there are gaps in the extent and effectiveness of how students use them. With over two years of widespread GenAI usage, it is crucial to understand whether students' help-seeking behaviors with these tools have evolved and how. This paper presents findings from a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted among computing students across North American universities ( n=95 ). Our results indicate shifts in GenAI usage patterns. In 2023, 34.1% of students ( n=47 ) reported never using ChatGPT for help, ranking it fourth after online searches, peer support, and class forums. By 2024, this figure dropped sharply to 6.3% ( n=48 ), with ChatGPT nearly matching online search as the most commonly used help resource. Despite this growing prevalence, there has been a decline in students' hourly and daily usage of GenAI tools, which may be attributed to a common tendency to underestimate usage frequency. These findings offer new insights into the evolving role of GenAI in computing education, highlighting its increasing acceptance and solidifying its position as a key help resource.},

abstract = {Recent studies have showcased the exceptional performance of LLMs (Large Language Models) on assessment questions across various discipline areas. This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks.},

abstract = {The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 kickstarted the release of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) applications to the public domain. Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

abstract = {Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT&nbsp;[8] and GPT-4&nbsp;[9] could enhance programming education in various roles, e.g., by acting as a personalized digital tutor for a student, a digital assistant for an educator, and a digital peer for collaborative learning&nbsp;[1, 2, 7]. In our work, we seek to comprehensively evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art large language models for various scenarios in programming education. Recent works have evaluated several large language models in the context of programming education&nbsp;[4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org &nbsp;[5] (see Figure&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

Such data could include code containing a typical distribution of errors, simulated student behavior to address the cold start problem when developing education tools, and synthetic user data when access to authentic data is restricted due to privacy reasons. In this research paper, we conduct a comparative study examining the distribution of bugs generated by LLMs in contrast to those produced by computing students. Leveraging data from two previous large-scale analyses of student-generated bugs, we investigate whether LLMs can be coaxed to exhibit bug patterns that are similar to authentic student bugs when prompted to inject errors into code. The results suggest that unguided, LLMs do not generate plausible error distributions, and many of the generated errors are unlikely to be generated by real students. However, with guidance including descriptions of common errors and typical frequencies, LLMs can be shepherded to generate realistic distributions of errors in synthetic code.},

However, there exist potential opportunities as well. For example, ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human language allows providing personalized feedback to students, and can thus accompany current software engineering education approaches. This paper highlights the potential for enhancing software engineering education. The availability of generative AI will improve the individualization of education approaches. In addition, we discuss the need to adapt software engineering curricula to the changed profiles of software engineers. Moreover, we point out why it is important to provide guidance for using generative AI and, thus, integrate it in courses rather than accepting the unsupervised use by students, which can negatively impact the students' learning.},

abstract = {New breakthroughs in code synthesis from Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms are driving significant changes to software engineering education. Having algorithms able to generate components of a software project means that software developers will need stronger skills in requirements specification to guide code generation as well as stronger skills in code review, testing, and integration to incorporate AI-generated code into projects. Shifts in industry and classroom practices are already occurring with the availability of inline code generation tools like GitHub's Copilot, which makes discussion of pedagogical strategies in this area a timely topic. Of immediate concern in computer science education is the potential for LLM-generated code and code help to undermine the learning of CS students. In order to avoid such undermining in even intentional uses of LLM-enhanced learning supports, it is necessary to clarify the roles such supports need to play in the pedagogical process. The Computer Science Matrix Taxonomy provides a strong framework for organizing software testing learning outcomes as well as delineating the operational space in which LLM-based feedback tools should operate to support those learning outcomes. In this paper, the authors operationalize the CS Matrix Taxonomy for software testing learning outcomes and illustrate the integration of LLM-generated test strategy suggestions as an extension of the peer coding/testing model. The work includes examples of AI-generated code testing suggestions that students would use to help guide their own code synthesis for assignments or projects.},

abstract = {Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior – in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students (n = 964) solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming.},

abstract = {Providing personalized and timely feedback for student's programming assignments is useful for programming education. Automated program repair (APR) techniques have been used to fix the bugs in programming assignments, where the Large Language Models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results. Given the growing complexity of identifying and fixing bugs in advanced programming assignments, current fine-tuning strategies for APR are inadequate in guiding the LLM to identify bugs and make accurate edits during the generative repair process. Furthermore, the autoregressive decoding approach employed by the LLM could potentially impede the efficiency of the repair, thereby hindering the ability to provide timely feedback. To tackle these challenges, we propose FastFixer, an efficient and effective approach for programming assignment repair. To assist the LLM in accurately identifying and repairing bugs, we first propose a novel repair-oriented fine-tuning strategy, aiming to enhance the LLM's attention towards learning how to generate the necessary patch and its associated context. Furthermore, to speed up the patch generation, we propose an inference acceleration approach that is specifically tailored for the program repair task. The evaluation results demonstrate that FastFixer obtains an overall improvement of 20.46% in assignment fixing when compared to the state-of-the-art baseline. Considering the repair efficiency, FastFixer achieves a remarkable inference speedup of 16.67\texttimes{} compared to the autoregressive decoding algorithm.},

abstract = {Recent research has explored the creation of questions from code submitted by students. These Questions about Learners' Code (QLCs) are created through program analysis, exploring execution paths, and then creating code comprehension questions from these paths and the broader code structure. Responding to the questions requires reading and tracing the code, which is known to support students' learning. At the same time, computing education researchers have witnessed the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have taken the community by storm. Researchers have demonstrated the applicability of these models especially in the introductory programming context, outlining their performance in solving introductory programming problems and their utility in creating new learning resources. In this work, we explore the capability of the state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in answering QLCs that are generated from code that the LLMs have created. Our results show that although the state-of-the-art LLMs can create programs and trace program execution when prompted, they easily succumb to similar errors that have previously been recorded for novice programmers. These results demonstrate the fallibility of these models and perhaps dampen the expectations fueled by the recent LLM hype. At the same time, we also highlight future research possibilities such as using LLMs to mimic students as their behavior can indeed be similar for some specific tasks.},

With N=86 students, this course implemented a policy that promotes responsible AI use through guidelines and an "AI-usage disclosure" form for coursework submissions. This approach sought to improve AI literacy, ensure academic integrity, and mitigate potential academic misconduct cases. Despite challenges, including adherence to AI disclosures and the evolving definition of AI tools, the policy promoted a more inclusive learning environment and encouraged a deeper understanding of AI’s role and limitations in computer science education.

This calls for replication of studies and reexamination of findings from pre-GenAI CS contexts to understand the impact on students. Objectives: Achievement Goals are well studied in computing education and can be predictive of student interest and exam performance. The objective in this study is to compare findings from prior achievement goal studies in CS1 courses with new CS1 courses that emphasize the use of human-GenAI collaborative coding. Methods: In a CS1 course that integrates GenAI, we use linear regression to explore the relationship between achievement goals and prior experience on student interest, exam performance, and perceptions of GenAI. Results: As with prior findings in traditional CS1 classes, Mastery goals are correlated with interest in computing. Contradicting prior CS1 findings, normative goals are correlated with exam scores. Normative and mastery goals correlate with students’ perceptions of learning with GenAI. Mastery goals weakly correlate with reading and testing code output from GenAI.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

abstract = {Large language models are reshaping computing education. Based on recent research, these models explain code better than students, answer multiple choice questions at or above the class average, and generate code that can pass automated tests in introductory courses. In response to these capabilities, instructors have quickly adjusted their courses and assessment methods to align with shifting learning goals and the increased risk of academic integrity issues. While some scholars have advocated for the integration of visual problems as a safeguard against the capabilities of language models, new multimodal models now have vision and language capabilities that may allow them to analyze and solve visual problems. In this paper, we compare the large multimodal model (LMMs) GPT-4V with Bard, an LLM that uses Google Lens for text recognition. We find that LMMs, which have learned both pixel features (from images) and text features (from prompts) in the same embedding space, performed substantially better than Bard which uses a piecemeal approach. With a specific focus on Parsons problems presented across diverse visual representations, our results show that GPT-4V solved 96.7% these visual problems, struggling minimally with a single Parsons problem. Conversely, Bard performed poorly by only solving 69.2% of problems, struggling with common issues like hallucinations and refusals. These findings suggest that merely transitioning to visual programming problems might not be a panacea to issues of academic integrity in the generative AI era.},

abstract = {Novice programmers often face challenges in designing computational artifacts and fixing code errors, which can lead to task abandonment and over-reliance on external support. While research has explored effective meta-cognitive strategies to scaffold novice programmers' learning, it is essential to first understand and assess students' conceptual, procedural, and strategic/conditional programming knowledge at scale. To address this issue, we propose a three-model framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate, classify, and correct student responses to programming questions based on the SOLO Taxonomy. The SOLO Taxonomy provides a structured approach for categorizing student understanding into four levels: Pre-structural, Uni-structural, Multi-structural, and Relational. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieved high accuracy in generating and classifying responses for the Relational category, with moderate accuracy in the Uni-structural and Pre-structural categories, but struggled with the Multi-structural category. The model successfully corrected responses to the Relational level. Although further refinement is needed, these findings suggest that LLMs hold significant potential for supporting computer science education by assessing programming knowledge and guiding students toward deeper cognitive engagement.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment.

abstract = {The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant debate, highlighting both their potential to augment student learning and the risks associated with their misuse. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, primarily focusing on evaluating the performance of existing models or conducting short-term human subject studies. However, very little work has examined the impacts of LLM-powered assistants on students in entry-level programming courses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To address this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study with 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our research team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the "CodeTutor group" as the experimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their final scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the "control group"). Within the CodeTutor group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered tools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their counterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding CodeTutor's capability to comprehend their queries and assist in learning programming language syntax. However, they had concerns about CodeTutor's limited role in developing critical thinking skills. Over the course of the semester, students' agreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for support from traditional human teaching assistants. Our findings also show that students turned to CodeTutor for different tasks, including programming task completion, syntax comprehension, and debugging, particularly seeking help for programming assignments. Our analysis further reveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with CodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon these results, we discuss the implications of our findings for the need to integrate Generative AI literacy into curricula to foster critical thinking skills, and turn to examining the temporal dynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the discrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual capabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve educational outcomes.},

abstract = {Instructional videos are becoming increasingly popular among computer science students. Over 78% of students frequently visit YouTube to find videos as supplement to their textbook or classroom instruction[1]. Recent surveys show that on average, 73% of students prefer having their instructors curate a supplemental video library to aid in their learning. Now, the emergence of generative AI is revolutionizing supplemental video instruction, enabling instructors to generate slides, recording scripts, and produce high-quality videos with deep search and embedded interactive activities.Generative AI also takes the student video learning to a new level by providing AI-generated video summaries, on-demand questions, and exploration of topics in greater depth. Integrating AI into standard videos greatly expands the possibilities of video-based learning. This workshop demonstrates how educators can enhance their existing video playlists by incorporating AI to increase student engagement and establish safety measures for AI use in education. By using dynamic dashboards, scheduled content, and gamified questions, instructors can maintain student focus.Drawing on insights from computer science courses taught at Princeton and Rutgers Universities, we will highlight the transformative potential of AI-enhanced videos in promoting active learning, particularly in large classes. We will discuss engagement strategies and real-time data visualizations applicable to any video platform. We will utilize the cubits.ai[2] platform, a Princeton University initiative that enhances the impact of computer science courses. The platform is free, and participants are encouraged to bring their own video playlists to curate them into AI-enabled collections by enhancing the student experience through integrated generative AI.},

We present an example of an assessment which allows learners to use GenAI in a freeform, constructionist manner, as part of a large, software development project. This work is inspired by previously executed AI-focused assessments and surveys, which explicitly indicate that learners on an Applied Software Engineering Degree Apprenticeship Programme want to formally learn how to use GenAI tools when programming and their employers want to see these skills from graduates. The learning outcome of the assignment was for learners to explore a typical developmental pipeline as a solo developer, moving from design to development to finished product. Learners were marked exclusively on their end product and understanding of application components, not the written code itself, resulting in an assessment where the end product and project were prioritised over foundational code (which was adequately assessed in other components). The results show that all learners used GenAI to some extent during their project, and in all cases, they found it beneficial for large programming tasks. Learners were generally able to produce a larger, more comprehensive and more ambitious project, compared to previous years. It is proposed that removing the barrier to GenAI - and demystifying it - can encourage a constructionist approach to its use, and normalise it as a potential tool for programming.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

abstract = {As generative AI increasingly integrates into society and education, the number of institutions implementing AI usage policies and offering introductory AI courses is rising. These introductory AI courses mustn't replicate the "gateway/weed-out" phenomenon observed in introductory computer science courses like CS1 and CS2. Literature in computer science education suggests that interventions such as summer camps, bridge courses, and socio-technical courses have improved the sense of belonging and retention among students from underrepresented groups, thereby broadening participation in computer science. Building on previous work to create a socio-technical curriculum for all ages and education levels, this paper presents a course for teaching introductory AI concepts that adopts a socio-technical approach, complete with weekly activities and content designed for broad access. The course has been taught as a 1-credit general education course, primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors, and a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels.This paper provides a curriculum and resources to teach a socio-technical introductory AI course. This approach is important because it not only democratizes AI education across diverse student backgrounds but also equips all students with the critical socio-technical multidisciplinary perspective necessary to navigate and shape the future ethical landscape of AI technology.},

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of coding LLMs in solving these problems.Based on the findings, the paper discusses the challenges faced by the computer science education community and potential strategies to address them. The advent of coding LLMs poses significant challenges to traditional teaching and learning methods in computer science. These challenges include the need for strategies to mitigate any negative impact of LLMs on the learning process.

While numerous standards and guidelines have been established to aid developers in creating accessible content, studies reveal a persistent lack of accessibility in many web and mobile applications. This gap is often attributed to barriers such as lack of awareness, insufficient knowledge, absence of specific requirements, time constraints, and lack of executive support. In this context, we aim to address the lack of awareness and knowledge challenges by proposing a hands-on approach that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to enhance students' accessibility awareness, knowledge, and practical skills. We engaged software engineering students in tasks involving website development and accessibility evaluation using checker tools, and we utilized ChatGPT 3.5 to fix identified accessibility issues. Our findings suggest that practical assignments significantly enhance learning outcomes, as interactions with LLMs allow students to develop a deeper understanding of accessibility concepts. This approach not only reinforces theoretical knowledge but also highlights the real-world impact of their work. The results indicate that combining practical assignments with AI-driven support effectively improves students' proficiency in web accessibility.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {Non-native English speakers (NNES) face multiple barriers to learning programming. These barriers can be obvious, such as the fact that programming language syntax and instruction are often in English, or more subtle, such as being afraid to ask for help in a classroom full of native English speakers. However, these barriers are frustrating because many NNES students know more about programming than they can articulate in English. Advances in generative AI (GenAI) have the potential to break down these barriers because state of the art models can support interactions in multiple languages. Moreover, recent work has shown that GenAI can be highly accurate at code generation and explanation. In this paper, we provide the first exploration of NNES students prompting in their native languages (Arabic, Chinese, and Portuguese) to generate code to solve programming problems. Our results show that students are able to successfully use their native language to solve programming problems, but not without some difficulty specifying programming terminology and concepts. We discuss the challenges they faced, the implications for practice in the short term, and how this might transform computing education globally in the long term.},

Simultaneously, AI tools present a unique opportunity to personalize education and encourage self-driven learning. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of AI-based tools on teaching and learning and to find a way forward in building a framework that directly addresses the challenges raised by generative AI in three main areas: strategies for AI-aware teaching, reliability of AI-generated knowledge and design of assessments. With a view towards acquiring a clearer picture of the new AI-aware teaching landscape, we have attempted to incorporate AI-tools in the classroom. We have experimented with using various AI-tools in designing assignments that co-opt AI for teaching and learning, whether it is a written essay on an IT topic, a programming assignment in Java or troubleshooting a systems administration issue, topics that cover the breath of our Information Technology program. The assessments provide clear instructions to students on acceptable and unacceptable ways of using specific AI-tools in completing the work. There is a feedback question in each assessment that seeks students' perception of AI-tools used, its strengths and weaknesses in learning. We plan to continue the experiment for an entire academic year using this methodology in various IT courses. In this work-in-progress presentation, we will discuss the results of the assessments administered so far and provide an overview of the resulting draft AI-aware framework of teaching and learning in the IT discipline.},

abstract = {This research paper aims to analyze the strengths and weaknesses associated with the utilization of ChatGPT as an educational tool in the context of undergraduate computer science education. ChatGPT's usage in tasks such as solving assignments and exams has the potential to undermine students' learning outcomes and compromise academic integrity. This study adopts a quantitative approach to demonstrate the notable unreliability of ChatGPT in providing accurate answers to a wide range of questions within the field of undergraduate computer science. While the majority of existing research has concentrated on assessing the performance of Large Language Models in handling programming assignments, our study adopts a more comprehensive approach. Specifically, we evaluate various types of questions such as true/false, multi-choice, multi-select, short answer, long answer, design-based, and coding-related questions. Our evaluation highlights the potential consequences of students excessively relying on ChatGPT for the completion of assignments and exams, including self-sabotage. We conclude with a discussion on how can students and instructors constructively use ChatGPT and related tools to enhance the quality of instruction and the overall student experience.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) present a transformative opportunity to address longstanding challenges in computing education. This paper presents a conversational AI extension to an LLM-enhanced C/C++ compiler which generates pedagogically sound programming error explanations. Our new tool, DCC Sidekick, retains compiler integration, allowing students to see their code, error messages, and stack frames alongside a conversational AI interface. Compiler context improves error explanations, and provides a seamless development experience. We present quantitative analyses of Sidekick's usage and engagement patterns in a large CS1 course. In the first seven weeks of use, 959 students initiated 11,222 DCC Sidekick sessions, generating 17,982 error explanations. Over half of all conversations occur outside of business hours, highlighting the value of these always-available tools. Early results indicate strong adoption of conversational AI debugging tools, demonstrating scalability in supporting large CS1 courses. We share implementation details and lessons learned, offering guidance to educators considering integrating AI tools with pedagogical guardrails.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are already heavily used by professional software engineers. An important skill for new university graduates to possess will be the ability to use such LLMs to effectively navigate and modify a large code base. While much of the prior work related to LLMs in computing education focuses on novice programmers learning to code, less work has focused on how upper-division students use and trust these tools, especially while working with large code bases. In this study, we taught students about various GitHub Copilot features, including Copilot chat, in an upper-division software engineering course and asked students to add a feature to a large code base using Copilot. Our analysis revealed a novel interaction pattern that we call one-shot prompting, in which students ask Copilot to implement the entire feature at once and spend the next few prompts asking Copilot to debug the code or asking Copilot to regenerate its incorrect response. Finally, students reported significantly more trust in the code comprehension features than code generation features of Copilot, perhaps due to the presence of trust affordances in the Copilot chat that are absent in the code generation features. Our study takes the first steps in understanding how upper-division students use Github Copilot so that our instruction can adequately prepare students for a career in software engineering.},

abstract = {As the prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows in various sectors, their potential in education warrants exploration. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

abstract = {Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student’s code submission passes each test case and 2) the student’s open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.},

Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER, however, has focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments and judging the quality of programming feedback, contrasting the results with proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to introductory Python programming exercises suggest that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs are nearly on par with proprietary models in both generating and assessing programming feedback. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in these tasks and highlight the wide range of LLMs accessible, even for free, to educators and practitioners.},

In computing education, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these models to improve learning and teaching experiences in university-level programming courses. However, research into leveraging them to aid computer science instructors in curriculum development and course material design is relatively sparse, especially at the K-12 level. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the capability of large language models in ideating and designing culturally responsive projects for elementary and middle school programming classes. Our ultimate goal is to support K-8 teachers in effectively extracting suggestions from large language models by only using natural language modifications. Furthermore, we aim to develop a comprehensive assessment framework for culturally responsive AI-generated project ideas. We also hope to provide valuable insight into teachers’ perspectives on large language models and their integration into teaching practices.},

We investigate an opportunity for a positive impact of LLMs on NNES through multilingual programming exercise generation. Following previous work with LLM exercise generation in English, we prompt OpenAI GPT-3.5 in 4 natural languages (English, Tamil, Spanish, and Vietnamese) to create introductory programming problems, sample solutions, and test cases. We evaluate these problems on their sensibility, readability, translation, sample solution accuracy, topicality, and cultural relevance. We find that problems generated in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese are largely sensible, easily understood, and accurate in their sample solutions. However, Tamil problems are mostly non-sensible and have a much lower passing test rate, indicating that the abilities of LLMs for problem generation are not generalizable across languages. Our analysis suggests that these problems could not be given verbatim to students, but with minimal effort, most errors can be fixed. We further discuss the benefits of these problems despite their flaws, and their opportunities to provide personalized and culturally relevant resources for students in their native languages.},

abstract = {The integration of large language models (LLMs) into computing education offers many potential benefits to student learning, and several novel pedagogical approaches have been reported in the literature. However LLMs also present challenges, one of the most commonly cited being that of student over-reliance. This challenge is compounded by the fact that LLMs are always available to provide instant help and solutions to students, which can undermine their ability to independently solve problems and diagnose and resolve errors. Providing instructor oversight of LLM-generated content can mitigate this problem, however it is often not practical in real-time learning contexts. Online class discussion forums, which are widely used in computing education, present an opportunity for exploring instructor oversight because they operate asynchronously. Unlike real-time interactions, the discussion forum format aligns with the expectation that responses may take time, making oversight not only feasible but also pedagogically appropriate. In this practitioner paper, we present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a ‘bot’ module that is controlled by the instructor, and integrated into an online discussion forum. The bot assists the instructor by generating draft responses to student questions, which are reviewed, modified, and approved before release. Key features include the ability to leverage course materials, access archived discussions, and publish responses anonymously to encourage open participation. We report our experiences using this tool in a 12-week second-year software engineering course on object-oriented programming. Instructor feedback confirmed the tool successfully alleviated workload but highlighted a need for improvement in handling complex, context-dependent queries. We report the features that were viewed as most beneficial, and suggest avenues for future exploration.},

However, creating scenarios to explore the software (such as test charters) can be time-consuming, and depending on the team’s experience, it may lack adequate coverage of functionalities and scenarios that target specific user profiles of the application. Objective: This article investigates how AI, through LLMs (Large Language Models), can assist in creating exploratory test charters that reflect the characteristics and needs of different user personas. Method: To achieve this, an experimental study was conducted where personas were used as input in ChatGPT 3.5 to generate exploratory test charters. The effectiveness of the approach was evaluated by Software Engineering students, who analyzed the performance and usefulness of the generated charters through a questionnaire based on the TAM model, supplemented by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results: Data analysis indicated positive acceptance of ChatGPT 3.5 by the participants, highlighting its ease of use and perceived usefulness. Conclusion: This study contributes to the field of Software Engineering by demonstrating a practical application of artificial intelligence in the automated generation of test charters. ChatGPT 3.5 has proven to be a promising tool to support the creation of personalized exploratory test charters, contributing to software quality improvement. The integration of artificial intelligence techniques with user-centered design methods can significantly optimize the software testing process.},

Next, we will examine the current policy (such as the European AI Act, and European Commission guidelines on the use of AI and data in education and training as well as international counterparts). Policies are often developed by both educators and experts in the domain, thus providing a source of topics or areas that may be added to our findings.

abstract = {Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, has garnered attention in computer science education. This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey.With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.},

abstract = {Teachers often utilize automatic program repair methods to provide feedback on submitted student code using model answer code. A state-of-the-art tool is Refactory, which achieves a high repair success rate and small patch size (less code repair) by refactoring code to expand the variety of correct code samples that can be referenced. However, Refactory has two major limitations. First, it cannot fix code with syntax errors. Second, it has difficulty fixing code when there are few correct submissions. Herein we propose a new method that combines Refactory and OpenAI's GPT models to address these issues and conduct a performance measurement experiment. The experiment uses a dataset consisting of 5 programming assignment problems and almost 1,800 real-life incorrect Python program submissions from 361 students for an introductory programming course at a large public university. The proposed method improves the repair success rate by 1-21% when the set of correct code samples is sufficient and the patch size is smaller than Refactory alone in 16-45% of the cases. When there was no set of correct code samples at all (only the model answer code was used as a reference for repair), method improves the repair success rate by 1-43% and the patch size is smaller than Refactory alone in 42-68% of the cases.},

AIDEs are programming tools that, given comments or starter code, can generate code solution suggestions. As the accuracy of these tools continues to increase, one particular AIDE from Github, Copilot, has been gaining significant attention for its performance and ease of use. The rise of Copilot suggests that code solution generation tools will soon be commonplace in both the industry and in computer science courses, with expert and novice programmers alike benefiting from using these tools. More specifically for novices, the effects of Copilot on the process of learning to code are mostly unknown. In this paper, we perform initial explorations into these effects. Using introductory computer science and data science courses, we evaluate Copilot-generated programming assignment solutions for correctness, style, skill level appropriateness, grade scores, and potential plagiarism. Our findings indicate Copilot generates mostly unique code that can solve introductory assignments with human-graded scores ranging from 68% to 95%. Based on these results, we provide recommendations for educators to help adapt their courses to incorporate new AIDE-based programming workflows.},

This study takes on a restorying approach at the elementary level, where 9 fourth-grade students engaged in focus group discussions over three days to generate prompts for a generative AI art. Through the lens of restorying, the prompts had students conceptualize a future with a focus on their Mexican-American heritage, local community, and technology. The study revealed that students associated their heritage with symbolic representations such as food and music, and characterized the community as a commercialized space while also emphasizing locations conducive to family-oriented activities. As a result, technology in community spaces was associated with consumerism. However, when envisioning a futuristic, transformed community, they made deeper connections between the role of technology in the community, making intricate connections between community improvements and technology-based solutions. This underscores the need for computing education to dedicate time for young learners to reflect on the role technology has on their current culture and community to make deeper connections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT. The pace of advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates the use of existing infrastructure to automate the evaluation of LLM performance on computing education tasks. Concept inventories are well suited for evaluation because of their careful design and prior validity evidence. OBJECTIVES. Our research explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework to evaluate computer science (CS) concept inventories. We explore three primary objectives: evaluation of LLM performance on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories; informal expert panel review of items which had variations between LLM and expected student performance; and description of challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation. METHOD. We used the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework to evaluate the SCS1 and BDSI against 10 LLMS with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning: GPT (3.5, 4.0), Claude (1.3, 2.0, 2.1), Llama (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral v0.1 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B. We used psychometric data from prior studies to measure knowledge levels for each LLM run. We then conducted an informal expert review to qualitatively explore how question design, CS content knowledge, and LLM design may explain differences between LLM and expected student performances. FINDINGS. Our quantitative analysis found that most LLM response patterns reflected a below average introductory computing student with the SCS1 and did not fit the psychometric 2PL model for the BDSI. Our qualitative analysis identified that LLMs performed well on code infill questions, but poorly on nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer questions. We also identified several methodological challenges related to item security, translation, the structure when using HELM. IMPLICATIONS. We consider the feasibility of using automated benchmarking as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous investigations to understand the intersection of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. We also consider connections between psychometric approaches and LLM evaluations to inform the design of computing assessments that are more resilient to LLM advancements.},

We further reflect on the question raised by Begel and Ko whether technology should “structure learning for learners” or whether learners should “be taught how to structure their own independent learning” outside of the classroom.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of code generation tools powered by large language models has attracted wide attention. Models such as OpenAI Codex can take natural language problem descriptions as input and generate highly accurate source code solutions, with potentially significant implications for computing education. Given the many complexities that students face when learning to write code, they may quickly become reliant on such tools without properly understanding the underlying concepts. One popular approach for scaffolding the code writing process is to use Parsons problems, which present solution lines of code in a scrambled order. These remove the complexities of low-level syntax, and allow students to focus on algorithmic and design-level problem solving. It is unclear how well code generation models can be applied to solve Parsons problems, given the mechanics of these models and prior evidence that they underperform when problems include specific restrictions. In this paper, we explore the performance of the Codex model for solving Parsons problems over various prompt variations. Using a corpus of Parsons problems we sourced from the computing education literature, we find that Codex successfully reorders the problem blocks about half of the time, a much lower rate of success when compared to prior work on more free-form programming tasks. Regarding prompts, we find that small variations in prompting have a noticeable effect on model performance, although the effect is not as pronounced as between different problems.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have led to the emergence of generative AI models that exhibit extraordinary performance at producing human-like outputs. Using only simple input prompts, it is possible to generate novel text, images, video, music, and source code, as well as tackle tasks such as answering questions and translating and summarising text.However, the potential for these models to impact computing education practice is only just beginning to be explored. For example, novices learning to code can now use free tools that automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments; yet these tools were not designed with novices in mind and little to nothing is known about how they will impact learning. Furthermore, much attention has focused on the immediate challenges these models present, such as academic integrity concerns. It seems that even in the AI-era a pending apocalypse sells better than a promising renaissance.Generative AI will likely play an increasing role in people's lives in the reasonably foreseeable future. Model performance seems set to continue accelerating while novel uses and new possibilities multiply. Given this, we should devote just as much effort to identifying and exploiting new opportunities as we do to identifying and mitigating challenges.In this talk, we begin by discussing several concrete and research-backed opportunities for computing educators. Many of these have already shown great promise in positively impacting current practice. We then discuss more short- to medium-term possibilities in areas such as student recruitment, and curricular changes. Finally - against our better judgement - we speculate over the longer-term, including rethinking the very fundamentals of the practice of teaching introductory and advanced computing courses. In these discussions we suggest potential research questions and directions. Although making remotely accurate predictions in such a fast-changing landscape is foolhardy, we believe that now is the time to explore and embrace opportunities to help make positive change in as many computing classrooms as possible.},

There is great potential in incorporating AIDEs into Computer Science education; however, the effects of these tools should be fully examined before doing so. Here, a within-subjects study was conducted to compare the programming performance, workload, emotion, and self-efficacy of seventeen novices coding with and without use of the GitHub Copilot AIDE under time pressure. Results showed that using the AIDE significantly increased programming efficiency and reduced effort and mental workload but did not significantly impact emotion or self-efficacy. However, participants' performance improved with more experience using the AI, and their self-efficacy followed. The results suggest that students who try AIDEs will likely be tempted to use them for time-sensitive work. There is no evidence that providing AIDEs will aid struggling students, but there is a clear need for students to practice with AI to become competent and confident using it.},

To help ensure that these tools are used to enhance learning, educators need to not only be familiar with these tools, but with their use and potential misuse. The goal of this BoF is to raise awareness about LLMs and to build a learning community around their use in computing education. Aligned with this goal of building an inclusive learning community, our BoF is led by globally distributed discussion leaders, including undergraduate researchers, to facilitate multiple coordinated discussions that can lead to a broader conversation about the role of LLMs in CS education.},

abstract = {Practical programming assignments are critical parts of programming courses in Computer Science education. Students are expected to translate programming concepts learned from lectures into executable implementations that solve the tasks outlined in the assignments. These implementations are primarily assessed based on their functional correctness, ensuring that students' code produces the expected output when provided with specific inputs.However, functional correctness is not the only metric that evaluates the quality of programs. Runtime efficiency is a metric that is less frequently evaluated in programming courses, yet it holds significant importance in the context of professional software development. To investigate this gap and its potential ramifications, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the time efficiency of 250 programming assignments that are evaluated solely on functional correctness. The results demonstrate that students' programming assignments exhibit significant variance in terms of execution time. We further identified 27 recurring inefficient code patterns from these assignments, and observed that most of the inefficient patterns can be optimized by automated tools such as PMD, IntelliJ IDEA and ChatGPT. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for educators to enhance the organization and integration of code performance topics throughout the programming course curriculum.},

abstract = {Integrating AI-driven tools in higher education is an emerging area with transformative potential. This paper introduces Iris, a chat-based virtual tutor integrated into the interactive learning platform Artemis that offers personalized, context-aware assistance in large-scale educational settings. Iris supports computer science students by guiding them through programming exercises and is designed to act as a tutor in a didactically meaningful way. Its calibrated assistance avoids revealing complete solutions, offering subtle hints or counter-questions to foster independent problem-solving skills. For each question, it issues multiple prompts in a Chain-of-Thought to GPT-3.5-Turbo. The prompts include a tutor role description and examples of meaningful answers through few-shot learning. Iris employs contextual awareness by accessing the problem statement, student code, and automated feedback to provide tailored advice. An empirical evaluation shows that students perceive Iris as effective because it understands their questions, provides relevant support, and contributes to the learning process. While students consider Iris a valuable tool for programming exercises and homework, they also feel confident solving programming tasks in computer-based exams without Iris. The findings underscore students' appreciation for Iris' immediate and personalized support, though students predominantly view it as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, human tutors. Nevertheless, Iris creates a space for students to ask questions without being judged by others.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial intelligence for teaching and learning in the academic sphere is a trending subject of interest in computing education. ChatGPT, as an AI-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened student involvement, cooperation, accessibility, and availability. This paper addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing ChatGPT as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate Computer Science curriculum in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. Students having completed the course work for a Data Structures and Algorithms (a sophomore-level course) participated in this study. Two groups of students were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. The control group (group A) had access to textbooks and notes of programming courses, however, no Internet access was provided. Group B students were given access to ChatGPT and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using Programming Contest Control (PC2) environment which is widely used in ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of students addresses the problem by writing executable code that satisfies a certain number of test cases. Student teams were scored based on their performance in terms of the number of successfully passed test cases. Results show that students using ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however, there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted code consequently affecting the overall performance. After a thorough analysis, the paper’s findings indicate that incorporating AI in higher education brings about various opportunities and challenges. Nonetheless, universities can efficiently manage these apprehensions by adopting a proactive and ethical stance toward the implementation of such tools.},

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been driven by an exponential growth in digitised data. Natural language processing, in particular, has been transformed by machine learning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 which generates human-like text so realistic that its developers have warned of the dangers of its misuse. In recent months OpenAI released Codex, a new deep learning model trained on Python code from more than 50 million GitHub repositories. Provided with a natural language description of a programming problem as input, Codex generates solution code as output. It can also explain (in English) input code, translate code between programming languages, and more. In this work, we explore how Codex performs on typical introductory programming problems. We report its performance on real questions taken from introductory programming exams and compare it to results from students who took these same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We then explore how Codex handles subtle variations in problem wording using several published variants of the well-known “Rainfall Problem” along with one unpublished variant we have used in our teaching. We find the model passes many test cases for all variants. We also explore how much variation there is in the Codex generated solutions, observing that an identical input prompt frequently leads to very different solutions in terms of algorithmic approach and code length. Finally, we discuss the implications that such technology will have for computing education as it continues to evolve, including both challenges and opportunities.},

abstract = {Despite the exponential growth in demand for advanced computational skills driven by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, higher education institutions still face a significant shortage of dedicated course offerings pertaining to High Performance Computing (HPC). This educational deficiency not only hampers the preparedness of undergraduate students for cutting-edge postgraduate programs but also impairs their readiness to enter a dynamic workforce increasingly reliant on sophisticated computational capabilities. Integrating comprehensive HPC courses at the undergraduate level is critical for equipping students with expertise to effectively utilize modern computing technologies, and also for bridging the growing gap between academic preparation and industry demands. At Wake Forest University (WFU), we, members of the HPC Team, are actively working to address the educational gap in HPC by integrating the WFU HPC Facility[4] into higher-level elective courses across various disciplines. Recognizing the foundational importance of these skills, we have developed an introductory course specifically designed to equip students with the knowledge to excel in advanced courses, in graduate and research programs, and to meet the demands of the modern workforce. By integrating the WFU HPC Facility into our curriculum, the University is committed to pioneering a comprehensive educational pathway that empowers students to leverage the full potential of computing technologies in their future careers. WFU is an R-2 liberal arts institution with around 9,000 students[6] that actively supports undergraduate research through a multitude of departments and programs. Undergraduate research is so paramount to the University mission, that WFU has a dedicated center, the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) Center, just for this purpose. Many students engage in research projects that leverage the resources of the WFU HPC Facility. The facility’s main asset, the Distributed Environment for Academic Computing (DEAC) Cluster, contains approximately 4000 CPU cores and 20TB of RAM, and is a true interdisciplinary tool; in 2023 it was utilized by 15 departments and 500 active users to submit over 1.5 million computational tasks on a vast array of research topics. The interdisciplinary nature of the DEAC Cluster played an instrumental role in developing an introductory course in HPC that caters to students from a diverse number of majors. Having supported a wide range of researchers, we designed the course to bridge concepts and applications from Computer Science, Engineering, Data Science, and the Natural Sciences to their respective academic domains. By enabling students from multiple disciplines to access foundational HPC skills, we foster a versatile educational environment where collaborative and interdisciplinary learning thrives. One way that we ensure our introductory course is accessible to all students is that we do not require any prerequisite classes to enroll in the course. Students are also not expected to have any prior experience in programming. We have chosen Python as the primary programming language for the course, as it is one of the most versatile and widely-used languages in the fields of data science and machine learning, and can easily interface with parallel frameworks such as MPI and OpenMP. Students gain hands-on experience by developing asynchronous workflows, which are then executed on the DEAC Cluster. This practical focus not only demystifies complex computational concepts but also empowers students to apply their learning in real-world scenarios. HPC serves as a cornerstone for two distinct user groups, each integral to its advancement and application. The first encompasses those who enable and optimize HPC systems, including Computer Scientists, Computer Engineers, Systems Administrators, and Cyberinfrastructure Professionals, who enhance computational efficiency and build the underlying hardware infrastructure. The second group comprises scientists and researchers across diverse fields such as Statistics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Engineering, and more, who leverage HPC as a powerful tool for simulating complex phenomena, analyzing large datasets, and researching novel problems in their respective domains. While current course offerings at other institutions seem to prioritize the first group and educate students on how to build and enable an HPC cluster, we have chosen to prioritize curriculum for the second group as the skills they gain through our course’s curriculum will help them as they continue their academic career in higher level electives and independent research projects with faculty advisors. We choose to offer our course during the Spring semester in order to prepare students who may want to pursue research during the summer session. The first half of the course serves as foundational cluster training, familiarizing students with essential skills to work within an HPC environment. In this segment, students delve into the Linux command line interface (CLI) using Bashcrawl[3] and explore the intricacies of the Linux filesystem and environment modules. A significant focus is placed on understanding and utilizing job schedulers, such as the Slurm resource manager[2]. Another unique feature of this segment is the guided tour of the Wake Forest datacenter. This tour provides students with a tangible understanding of how the theoretical concepts discussed in class are implemented in a real-world HPC cluster. To further provide a reference to the resources requested for their jobs through Slurm, the tour concludes with students disassembling retired compute nodes to learn about the different components that comprise modern servers. The midterm assessment challenges students to submit multiple jobs, analyzing the effects of varying input sizes and the use of multiple CPU processors on calculation speed. Upon completion of this initial phase, students are fully equipped to engage in research activities under an advisor and effectively utilize an HPC cluster outside the confines of the classroom. Many apply for summer grants through the aforementioned URECA program with a faculty advisor. In the latter half of the course, the curriculum shifts towards more advanced topics, focusing on parallel computing frameworks and technologies. Students are introduced to MPI and OpenMP, which are essential for developing parallel applications that can run efficiently on today’s multi-processor systems. Additionally, the course delves into high-speed interconnects, crucial for optimizing communication between different parts of an HPC cluster. One of our final topics covers GPU computing, with a particular emphasis on using NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA programming platform, enabling students to harness the power of graphical processing for computational tasks. As an example from our Spring 2024 semester, students built a “chatbot” using Meta’s Llama 2 model[5] on both CPU and GPU using LLaMA C++[1], and compared its performance to ChatGPT while interacting freely with it. Our course is designed to complement other specialized courses found in Computer Science or in Computer Engineering programs, such as Parallel Algorithms, Computer Vision, or Deep Learning. It aims to introduce these critical computational concepts and provide a solid foundation that prepares students for these more advanced electives. By the end of the course, students are not only familiar with the basic principles of HPC but are also primed to tackle more specialized studies and research in their future academic and professional pursuits. It is not uncommon that a course may require students to use a specific programming language or software. While there are tools such as Google Colab and zyBooks that provide a browser-based interface to computing resources, those tools can be very limited in what resources they can provide. A faculty member might then want students to install software locally on their laptop, but this can be challenging when students bring their own device to the classroom as they may be running different operating systems or may have different hardware platforms. This can cause the software to behave differently or it may not even be available on that given platform. Courses with significant computational demands are better served utilizing a unified computing environment, and an HPC facility is ideally equipped to provide a consistent learning environment where each student has access to the same software and computing resources. A primary challenge in integrating HPC resources into coursework is instructing students on the use of schedulers for asynchronous workloads. Our introductory HPC course effectively bridges this gap by providing the necessary training and context, enabling students to engage with advanced topics more efficiently, without the steep initial learning curve typically associated with these environments. Our HPC facility has proven instrumental in enhancing educational experiences across a variety of disciplines, demonstrating significant benefits in classes such as Statistics, Natural Language Processing, Parallel Algorithms, Computer Vision, Physics Laboratory, Cancer Biology, Environmental Physics, Computational Modeling, and more. Moreover, students in fields like Finance and Business and Enterprise Management have also successfully leveraged our HPC resources, and have performed analysis on client data that was protected under a nondisclosure agreement which prevented students from storing the data locally on their laptop or with commercial cloud providers. This integration not only facilitates sophisticated computational tasks, but also allows students and faculty to easily share and store large datasets that the students may need to access without having to consume space on their local device. One of our primary goals is to promote diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration within this course, and this semester attracted a notably diverse group of students, with majors ranging from Biology and Statistics to Applied Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. Although the course is currently catalogued under the Computer Science department, we recognize that associating it with any single discipline could potentially limit its appeal and accessibility. The diverse enrollment underscores the interdisciplinary relevance of HPC skills across various fields of study. We are leveraging the current success and broad interest in the course as a foundation to establish a new academic program dedicated to High Performance Computing. This new program will serve as a hub for integrating computational skills across different disciplines, fostering a broader understanding and application of HPC in various scientific and economic sectors. The HPC team’s commitment to High Performance Computing education extends beyond traditional academic structures. While we are not developing a new major, minor, certificate track, or concentration in HPC, our objective is to make HPC education accessible and applicable across various disciplines without the constraints of a single departmental bias. This approach allows students from any field to engage with HPC skills as an integral part of their academic and professional development. To achieve this, we are actively collaborating with multiple academic departments to ensure that our HPC course offerings are recognized as fulfilling degree requirements across a range of programs. One way we collaborate with these departments is by altering activities and projects to use different languages and software, such as R and MATLAB, for the Statistics and Engineering departments, while still maintaining the same learning goals we achieve with Python. This strategy not only enhances the versatility of our course but also promotes a more comprehensive integration of the university’s HPC facilities into the curriculum. By doing so, we allow faculty in different departments to integrate our projects into their courses and utilize our HPC facility, even if it is for only one or two projects throughout the semester. Our efforts are focused on fostering a collaborative academic environment where the HPC facility is not just an isolated resource used for research but a central part of our educational infrastructure. By working across disciplines, we hope to catalyze a deeper engagement with HPC technologies throughout the university, enhancing both teaching and research capacities across departments. In conclusion, the escalating demand for big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is not only transforming industries but also reshaping educational requirements. As these fields expand, the need for substantial computational resources becomes increasingly critical. The HPC facility at Wake Forest University is exceptionally well-equipped to meet these demands, by providing a unified computing environment that supports an array of academic endeavors. Our initiative to develop introductory HPC courses is a strategic response to this need, preparing students to proficiently utilize HPC resources in higher-level electives and beyond. These courses are pivotal in bridging the gap between conventional academic programs and the rigorous computational needs of modern disciplines. Looking forward, the necessity for such educational offerings will only intensify as the reliance on advanced computational technologies grows. By anticipating and responding to these educational demands, Wake Forest University’s HPC academic program not only enhances student readiness for future challenges but also positions the university at the forefront of academic innovation in the computational sciences.},
